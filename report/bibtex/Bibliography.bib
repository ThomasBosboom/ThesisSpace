The space segment foresees a 12U CubeSat, placed at Earth–Moon L2, equipped with an optical instrument, the LUMIO-Cam, which is able to spot the flashes produced by impacts of meteoroids with the lunar surface. In this paper, the work undertaken to design the baseline orbit of LUMIO is documented. The methodology is thoroughly described, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, in support to the mission analysis trade-off activities. The baseline solution is presented with evidence to support the orbit design.},

  abstract  = {NASA's Global Exploration Strategy and proposed lunar architecture present a roadmap for future U.S. missions. The exploration plan begins with robotic precursor missions, followed by short human sorties, eventually progressing to a permanent base on the lunar surface. NASA's Lunar Architecture Team concluded that this permanent base would be located near the lunar South Pole. The location of an outpost at the lunar South limits direct communication links with the Earth. A lunar relay element will be necessary to provide critical communication and navigation support for the upcoming missions. This paper presents a highly evolvable, low-cost lunar relay constellation concept using small satellites in Halo orbits about the Earth-Moon libration points L1 and L2. The initial constellation is designed to provide coverage of the lunar south pole in support of the inaugural robotic missions and is easily expanded to provide global coverage. Two satellites in an L2 Halo orbit provide continuous South Pole coverage for the initial constellation. A final constellation providing nearly continuous global coverage can be achieved by the addition of two spacecraft in a Halo orbit about Li. A basic set of requirements and desired capabilities for the constellation is developed, based on NASA reports and Constellation C31 compatibility. A preliminary spacecraft bus and subsystems design is presented along with expected performance.},

  abstract = {This study presents an autonomous orbit determination system based on crosslink radiometric measurements applied to a future lunar CubeSat mission to clearly highlight its advantages with respect to existing ground-based navigation strategies. This work is based on the Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) method which provides an autonomous navigation solution solely using satellite-to-satellite measurements, such as range and/or range-rate, to estimate absolute spacecraft states when at least one of the involved spacecraft has an orbit with a unique size, shape, and orientation. The lunar vicinity is a perfect candidate for this type of application due to the asymmetrical gravity field: the selected lunar mission, an Earth-Moon L2 (EML2) Halo orbiter, has an inter-satellite link between a lunar elliptical frozen orbiter. Simulation results show that, even in case of high-measurement errors (in the order of 100 m, 1σ), the navigation filter estimates the true states of spacecraft at EML2 with an error in the order of 500 m for position, and 2 mm/s for velocity, respectively and the elliptical lunar frozen orbiter states can be estimated in the order of 100 m for position and 1 cm/s for velocity, respectively. This study shows that range-only measurements provide better state estimation than range-rate-only measurements for this specific situation. Different bias handling strategies are also investigated. It has been found that even a less accurate ranging method, such as data-aided ranging, provides a sufficient orbit determination solution. This would simplify the communication system design for the selected CubeSat mission. The most observable states are found to be position states of the lunar orbiter via the observability analysis. In addition, the best tracking windows are also investigated for the selected mission scenario.},
  comment  = {The characteristics of the acceleration function determine whether inter-satellite range or range-rate measurements can be used alone to estimate the absolute and relative Spacecraft (S/C) states.

Considering the asymmetric gravity field in the cislunar vicinity, it is possible to build such an autonomous navigation system.

In order to deal with on-board power limitations, time-derived ranging methods are a possible options for small satellites, dependent on data rate. Another measurement type is range-rate and this can be derived from the Doppler shift between satellites but, again, this measurement type suffers from on-board limitations.

This study didn’t consider clock drift and aging in the measurement model due to the short simulation duration. The simulation time is 14 days. Also doesn't consider other ranging methods other than time-based.

  abstract = {Distant retrograde orbits (DROs) in cislunar space offer a promising option for providing navigation services to satellites in the Earth-Moon system due to their long-term orbital stability and unique three-body orbital dynamics. The Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) technique is used to process the satellite-to-satellite tracking (SST) range measurements between a DRO satellite and another satellite in cislunar space to determine their absolute orbital states. The paper evaluates the navigation performances of the LiAISON, which are subject to dynamic model errors and satellite-borne clock errors. The clock models are presented, with a specific emphasis on modeling the non-Gaussian stochastic noise time series that are consistent with the clock instability. Comprehensive simulation results show that the SST system is observable. The DRO and Earth-orbit or lunar-orbit can obtain position accuracies of 100 m and several meters, respectively, and time synchronization accuracy is better than 100 ns. The Earth-Moon transfer orbit is less observable due to its long-orbital period that results in poor measurement geometry.},
  comment  = {LiAISON technique requires that at least one of the satellites be deployed in the asymmetrical gravity field of a three‐body system, such as a halo orbit around the lunar libration point.
In a symmetrical acceleration field, such as a two‐body system, a time history of the SST range measurements can only determine the size, shape, and relative orientation of both satellites’ orbits.

DROs are more stable and are used for communication relay as well. By contrast, Earth‐Moon liberation point halo orbits are usually unstable, requiring navigation and station‐keeping maneuvers once or twice per orbit. The ARTEMIS mission has successfully demonstrated quasi‐periodic station‐keeping at a cost of 5‐7 m/s per year. NRHOs are a subset of the L2 halo family and have better stability than other halos, with an annual station‐keeping cost of less than 5 m/s.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in space technology provide an opportunity for small satellites to be launched in cislunar space. However, tracking these small satellites still depends on ground-based operations. Autonomous navigation could be a possible solution considering the challenges presented by costly ground operations and limited onboard power available for small satellites. There have been various studies on autonomous navigation methods for cislunar missions. One of them, LiAISON, provides an autonomous orbit determination solution solely using inter-satellite measurements. This study aims at providing a detailed performance analysis of crosslink radiometric measurements based on autonomous orbit determination for cislunar small satellite formations considering the effects of measurement type, measurement accuracy, bias, formation geometry, and network topology. This study shows that range observations provide better state estimation performance than range-rate observations for the autonomous navigation system in cislunar space. Line-of-sight angle measurements derived from radiometric measurements do not improve the overall system performance. In addition, less precise crosslink measurement methods could be an option for formations in highly observable orbital configurations. It was found that measurement biases and measurements with high intervals reduce the overall system performance. In case there are more than two spacecraft in the formation, the navigation system in the mesh topology provides a better overall state estimation than the centralized topology.},
  comment  = {Limitations also come from the satellites, such as onboard power available for communications.

In addition, it is difficult to track all these small satellites due to the limited capacity of ground stations. Limitations also come from the satellites, such as onboard power available for communications. Considering all these challenges, an autonomous navigation system for cislunar missions could provide a possible solution. Also because makes use to existing technologies.

The orbit determination performance of LiAISON depends on various factors, such as measurement type, accuracy, bias, frequency, relative geometry between satellites, and others.

The observability of the system depends on one of the spacecraft occupying a unique orbit. Unique orbit depends on the asymmetry of an orbit. As part of the observability analysis, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), observability Gramian, and estimation error
covariance were considered. The degree of observability can be either checked via the observability Gramian or the information matrix. Both methods are related to each other via the measurement covariance matrix which provides weighted information about its observability. SVD of either gives degree of observability of state. Also condition number or observability index.

  abstract   = {In recent years, there is a growing interest in small satellites for deep space exploration. The current approach for planetary navigation is based on ground-based radiometric tracking. A new era of low-cost small satellites for space exploration will require autonomous deep space navigation. This will decrease the reliance on ground-based tracking and provide a substantial reduction in operational costs because of crowded communication networks. In addition, it will be an enabler for future missions currently impossible. This review investigates available deep space navigation methods from an autonomy perspective, considering trends in proposed deep space small satellite missions. Autonomous crosslink radiometric navigation, which is one of the best methods for small satellites due to its simplicity and the use of existing technologies, is studied, including available measurement methods, enabling technologies, and applicability to the currently proposed missions. The main objective of this study is to fill the gap in the scientific literature on the autonomous deep space navigation methods, deeply for crosslink radiometric navigation and to aim at showing the potential advantages that this technique could offer to the missions being analyzed. In this study, a total of 64 proposed deep space small satellite missions have been analyzed found from a variety of sources including journal papers, conference proceedings, and mission websites. In those missions, the most popular destinations are found to be cislunar space and small bodies with the purpose of surface mapping and characterization. Even though various autonomous navigation methods have been proposed for those missions, most of them have planned to use the traditional ground-based radiometric tracking for navigation purposes. This study also shows that more than half of the missions can benefit from the crosslink radiometric navigation through the inter-satellite link.},

- The covariance is not an a-posteriori measure of the tracking data quality and accuracy. This can only be derived from an analysis of the final distribution of the measurement residuals and by solving for systematic errors.
- Consider covariance matrix gives more realistic measure of OD accuracy. The consider covariance calculus is therefore well suited to assessing the impact of systematic errors in the orbit determination process. Typical examples of consider parameters are measurement biases, station location errors or uncertainties in the drag and radiation pressure model.
- Aside from the approximate state xapr0 that is required to start the least-squares orbit determination, some information on the accuracy of this value is often available (error covariance matrix).},

Earth-based lunar observations are restricted by weather, geometric and illumination conditions, while a lunar orbiter can improve the detection rate of lunar meteoroid impact flashes, as it would allow for longer monitoring periods. This paper will focus on the communications and radio navigation system of the mission, designed for the ESA roadmap for lunar exploration. LUMIO has been designed to operate autonomously after deployment from a lunar mother spacecraft in a low inclination lunar orbit and to reach without human intervention his final destination orbit close to the Earth-Moon L2 point, where science can be carried out. Being the destination orbit always in view from Earth (despite a distance of 460000 - 480000 km), Direct-to-Earth communication was added to the mission as a mean to reduce risk and allow independent verification of several of the innovative technologies that would be demonstrated, first of all autonomous navigation. A detailed link budget analysis will be presented for all mission phases for both the link with the mother spacecraft in low lunar orbit and the link with Earth. Beside defining the achievable data transfer, we will focus also on evaluating the available ground stations to better evaluate mission cost with respect to science return. Radio-navigation performances will also be evaluated to estimate the position and relative velocity accuracy, given also the limited performances available for the on-board navigation transponder. This will help also better defining the on-board autonomous navigation system, constraining the total error budget. Further strategies, such as beacon tones, will be evaluated to lower the overall operational cost by employing continuous monitoring with a low performances ground station and, only when needed, perform high speed downlink using a deep-space class ground station. This strategy is considered of extreme importance, especially for small missions, to allow opportunistic operations on high gain antennas, given their very busy schedule.

  abstract   = {The Earth-Moon system is constantly bombarded by meteoroids of different size and impact speed. Observation of the impacts on the Moon can enable thorough characterization of the Lunar meteoroid flux, which is similar to that of the Earth. While Earth-based Lunar observations are restricted by weather, geometric and illumination conditions, a Lunar-based observation campaign can improve the detection rate and, when observing the Lunar far side, complement in both space and time the observations taken from Earth. The Lunar Meteoroid Impact Observer (LUMIO), one of the two winning concepts of the ESA SysNova Lunar CubeSats for Exploration challenge, is a mission designed to observe, quantify, and characterize the micro-meteoroid impacts on the Lunar far side. It is based on a 12U CubeSat that carries the LUMIO-Cam, a custom-designed optical instrument capable of detecting light flashes in the visible spectrum. The spacecraft is placed on a halo orbit about the Earth–Moon L2 point, where permanent full-disk observation of the Lunar far side can be performed with excellent quality, given the absence of Earth background noise. After passing Phase 0 and an independent feasibility study in the ESA Concurrent Design Facility, the mission has successfully completed its Phase A in March 2021. Although the Phase 0 design of the LUMIO spacecraft was assessed as feasible by the ESA CDF study, a number of critical issues were identified, which have been tackled by the Phase A design. The paper presents the outcome of this Phase A design effort for the LUMIO spacecraft. Particularly relevant changes or updates in the spacecraft design include: a consolidated design of the LUMIO-Cam, with longer baffle for straylight protection; a set of ADCS sensors and actuators with increased redundancy; a combination of Direct-to-Earth communication and inter-satellite link with a mothership in Lunar orbit; use of Earth ranging to complement and validate the current innovative autonomous navigation strategy based on optical observations of the Moon by means of the LUMIO-Cam; re-assessment of the COTS components selection for the power and propulsion systems.},

For small satellites, orbit determination based solely on inter-satellite measurements could be a strong alternative for conventional ground-based navigation support. The possibilities of this autonomous orbit determination method are investigated, using LUMIO and Lunar Pathfinder mission aspects. The feasibility strongly depends on the estimated two-way ranging error, so the dependency between the radio parameters and performance in autonomous orbit determination is explored. To estimate the two-way error a link budget analysis is performed in which the bit rate and antenna gain are free parameters. In an iterative process, the radio parameters are obtained in which autonomous orbit determination can be performed in compliance with LUMIO’s mission requirements.},

Lagrange points are stable positions in the gravitational field of two large bodies that allow for a sustained presence of a spacecraft in a specific region. However, a challenge in operating at these points is the lack of fixed landmarks for orbit determination. The proposed solution involves using inter-satellite links to perform range and range-rate measurements, allowing for accurate computation of the spacecraft’s orbit parameters without the need for any facilities on Earth. Simulations using a fleet of three satellites in Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits around the Earth–Moon Lagrange point, proposed for the Lunar Gateway stations, were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. The results show that inter-satellite links can provide reliable and accurate solutions for orbit determination with a DRMS error lower than one meter (90th percentile) and synchronization errors of around one nanosecond. This solution paves the way for a fully autonomous fleet of spacecraft that can be used for observation, telecommunication, and navigation missions.},

  abstract  = {This study investigates the application of the Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAI-SON) technique for multiple small spacecraft in cislunar orbits considering high inter-satellite range measurement errors. The LiAISON method provides an autonomous orbit determination solution using crosslink measurements such as range, and/or range-rate. Inter-satellite ranging can be done via conventional tone or code based methods. Considering the limited on-board transmission power available on small satellites, ranging and data transfer, required to cope with the limited contact time, introduce further observable degradation and limiting performance. For such cases, and to increase the supported data rates, telemetry ranging and time-derived ranging architectures can be used. Unfortunately, in time-derived methods, measurements are not as accurate as using other methods, limiting the ap-plicability of such technique only to few missions. This paper presents a simulation based analysis to understand the limits of LiAISON for a multi-spacecraft mission at the Earth-Moon L1, L2 Halo and Lunar orbits considering high inter-satellite measurements errors due to time-derived and telemetry-based ranging methods and without Doppler measurements. This is specifically targeted at small satellites with limited power budgets and radio links lacking coherent Doppler tracking. The simulation results show that the LiAISON-based autonomous orbit determination works well for configurations of cislunar orbits, having the link between Lagrangian and Lunar orbits, even with high crosslink ranging errors.},

This presents an opportunity for the collection of measurements with respect to the lunar surface on each pass, which may be useful in estimating the full orbital state of lunar Gateway. Given that the Deep Space Network is already over-encumbered, finding new methods for generating orbit determination solutions and subsequent navigation solutions is a valuable venture. This analysis provides methods for finding periodic orbits in the circular-restricted three-body problem, develops means for measuring these trajectories via range and Doppler measurements and terrain-relative measurements with respect to the surface. These measurements are then processed with nonlinear and linear estimators to generate an orbit determination solution which is used to plan and construct orbit maintenance maneuvers in accordance with a risk for trajectory divergence. An x-axis crossing control methodology is used to generate an orbit maintenance solution which maintains operations about a reference trajectory.},

  abstract   = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-4382.vidAs cislunar space is poised for significant increases in mission activity, missions large and small are inherently constrained by the current availability of ground tracking systems. Increasing the complexity of this problem is the ambiguity with which schedule and mission scope can be accurately projected. Many of these missions will be operating in orbital regimes that require frequent tracking and station keeping, which drives the demand for navigation even higher. Advanced Space is aiming to mitigate the existing Earth based tracking and communications resource limitations by enabling spacecraft in the cislunar environment to navigate autonomously and reduce the need for oversubscribed ground assets for navigation and maneuver planning. Launched on June 28th, 2022 the Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE) mission is utilizing a highly capable 12U CubeSat to demonstrate the Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System (CAPS) software, as well as validate performance of navigation and stationkeeping for future operations in the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) that NASA has baselined for the Artemis Lunar Gateway architecture. The CAPS software enables cislunar missions to manage their navigation functions on-board and reduces the reliance on Earth based systems. Thus, this mission will provide tangible flight experience to NASA, commercial, and international missions for operations in a demanding orbital regime alongside a technical demonstration of a navigation capability that will support the establishment of necessary infrastructure for activities at the Moon. The mission will have an approximate four month flight with several maneuvers leading up to the NRHO insertion and then perform its primary mission over the next six months. From the launch deployment state, the spacecraft will traverse a low-energy Ballistic Lunar Transfer (BLT), which is an energy-efficient means of transferring from the LEO environment to an orbit near or about the Moon. The spacecraft will perform up to six Trajectory Correction Maneuvers (TCMs) to clean up launch injection, navigation, and maneuver execution errors prior to arriving at its lunar destination. The spacecraft will then perform a relatively small maneuver to insert into the NRHO. Two small clean-up maneuvers are planned to ensure that the spacecraft is successfully inserted into the NRHO. From there, small stationkeeping maneuvers, known as Orbit Maintenance Maneuvers (OMMs), are performed on a weekly cadence to remain in the NRHO. Upon arrival in the NRHO and settling into its daily operations cadence, the CAPSTONE spacecraft will initiate its navigation demonstration mission in collaboration with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) team at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center to demonstrate the CAPS autonomous navigation system. Success criteria for CAPSTONE in this demonstration are defined as 1) semi-autonomous operations and orbital maintenance of a spacecraft in an NRHO, 2) collection of inter-spacecraft ranging data in support of the autonomous navigation process, and 3) execution of the CAPS navigation software in an autonomous mode on-board the CAPSTONE spacecraft. Additionally, CAPSTONE will demonstrate an innovative one-way ranging navigation approach utilizing a Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) and additional autonomous navigation algorithms. Advanced Space, along with our partners at NASA, the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), Terran Orbital, Stellar Exploration, and Rocket Lab, have developed and implemented the CAPSTONE mission to support both NASA’s upcoming Gateway operations development and the expanding commercial cislunar economy. This high value mission will demonstrate an efficient low energy orbital transfer and NRHO insertion as well as full-scale operations in this unique orbit. Over the next 21 months, CAPSTONE will validate these key operations and navigation technologies required for the success of NASA’s l},
  comment    = {The tracking passes will occur when CAPSTONE is nearer to periapse, as LRO is in a polar, low lunar orbit. The availability of these passes will depend on several factors, including each spacecraft'spower, their relative distances, lunar occultations, pointing constraints, and LRO ongoing science operational priorities.

The objective for CAPSTONE is to accelerate the infusion of autonomous spacecraft navigation, where such crosslink tracking may support the navigation needs of both spacecraft in the link.},

It is well known that the covariance matrixes of process noise (Q) and measurement noise (R) have a significant impact on the Kalman filter's performance in estimating dynamic states. The conventional ad-hoc approaches for estimating the covariance matrixes are not adequate in achieving the best filtering performance. To address this problem, this paper proposes an adaptive filtering approach to adaptively estimate Q and R based on innovation and residual to improve the dynamic state estimation accuracy of the extended Kalman filter (EKF).

  comment = {- Appendix contains conversion from nondimensional barycentric frame to International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF).

- In the three-body problem, the gravitational influence of the third body can indirectly provide information about the direction to that third body and with it, the absolute orientation of the orbits. Because of the strong asymmetry of the three-body force field, there is only one possible orientation for that orbit, the absolute orientation of that orbit can also be determined.

- SST only provides information on the relative motion, used in conjunction with Earth-based tracking for absolute.

- With no symmetry present in the function f(r, t), the orbit generated with each set of initial conditions would be unique.

- For practical purposes, the effect of the asymmetric acceleration on the spacecraft trajectory must be significantly greater than the observation noise and the effects due to unmodeled accelerations.

- Orbits around the Lunar L1 and L2 libration points are ideal for testing Liaison Navigation since those orbits are locally unique and always remain in regions where the asymmetry of the third-body perturbation is very strong.

- The three collinear Lagrange points, L1, L2, and L3 are unstable equilibrium points, station keeping required. (Murray and Dermott, 1999)
- Instead of estimating the initial state with the measurements, the error in the initial state is estimated using the observation residuals, which are the observed measurements minus those computed from the reference solution.

 - To test whether Liaison Navigation is feasible, one of the most important steps is verifying that Λ is positive definite without Earth-based tracking, do not include P0 as can artificially warp observability.

- The batch processor is very useful at determining observability, but is awkward at giving an estimate of how the covariance would change when processing observations in real time. KF cannot verify observability, but can show covariance changes.

- The more revolutions a spacecraft can perform within the fit span, the more geometrically diverse observations can be obtained and the error is reduced. That's why Halo-Moon type constellations recover orbit information faster.

- The improved orbit accuracy for spacecraft in libration orbits provided by Liaison Navigation would lead to a decrease in the ∆V needed for stationkeeping, since more accurate knowledge of the orbit leads to smaller stationkeeping maneuvers. (Gomez et al., 1998)

- Important parameters to tracking scheduling:
      - Observation effectiveness dips at certain moments, "blackout periods".
      - For an unstable orbit like a halo orbit, the stability characteristics of the orbit create a more significant affect than a downtrack error.
      - Propagation of STM for one period leads to "Monodromy matrix": 6 entries refer to expansion and contraction of uncertainty.Sensing along direction of local unstable manifold increases observation effectiveness
     - Geometry of observations influence accuracy due to timing and extend of blackout periods.

- Upgrading the force model to include precise planetary ephemerides resulted in halo orbits with larger orbit determination errors than the CRTBP and the bicircular model.},

Large satellites with masses over 1000 kg support high-resolution remote sensing of the Earth, high bandwidth communications services, and world-class scientific studies but take lengthy developments and are costly to build and launch. The advent of commercially available, high-volume, and hence low-cost microelectronics has enabled a different approach through miniaturization. This results in physically far smaller satellites that dramatically reduce timescales and costs and that are able to provide operational and commercially viable services. This paper charts the evolution and rise of small satellites from being an early curiosity with limited utility through to the present where small satellites are a key element of modern space capabilities.},

To incorporate these dynamical structures into the mission design process, Purdue University and the NASA Goddard Flight Space Center have initiated the construction of a trajectory design framework to rapidly access and compare solutions from the circular restricted three-body problem. This framework, based upon a ‘dynamic’ catalog of periodic and quasi-periodic orbits within the Earth–Moon system, can guide an end-to-end trajectory design in an ephemeris model. In particular, the inclusion of quasi-periodic orbits further expands the design space, potentially enabling the detection of additional orbit options. To demonstrate the concept of a ‘dynamic’ catalog, a prototype graphical interface is developed. Strategies to characterize and represent periodic and quasi-periodic information for interactive trajectory comparison and selection are discussed. Two sample applications for formation flying near the Earth–Moon L2 point and lunar space infrastructures are explored to demonstrate the efficacy of a ‘dynamic’ catalog for rapid trajectory design and validity in higher-fidelity models.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT: Small satellites are growing in use for educational, scientific, and commercial purposes, usually in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) flights, given their lower costs and associated risks, as well as smaller lead times for assembling and testing. However, the typically short periods of LEO passes bring the need to find ways of optimizing the communication between the ground and space segments. In that direction, several projects have relied on ground station networks to increase the total time of contact with the satellites. In this type of arrangement, the stations agree in monitoring one or more satellites in such a way that, as the spacecraft exits one station’s field of view, another station assumes its tracking, extending the total communication time and compensating the short passes. This type of solution, while very efficient in terms of costs, on the other hand demands a good synchronization procedure, so that all constraints present in its operations are taken into account and the network can operate effectively. This paper aims at describing a model implemented for orchestrating ground station networks that optimizes the communication capacity of the ground network, while taking into account physical constraints not usually considered in other models currently proposed.},

Given the proper description of the force field, LiAISON is capable of producing absolute orbit determination solutions using relative satellite-to-satellite tracking observations alone. The lack of direct communication between Earth-based tracking stations and the far side of the Moon provides an ideal opportunity for implementing LiAISON. This paper presents a novel approach to use the LiAISON architecture to perform autonomous navigation of assets on the lunar far side surface. Relative measurements between a spacecraft placed in an EML-2 halo orbit and lunar surface asset(s) are simulated and processed. Comprehensive simulation results show that absolute states of the surface assets are observable with an achieved accuracy of the position estimate on the order of tens of meters.},

Linear models and Monte Carlo simulation were primarily used to propagate uncertainties. However, due to the nonlinear nature of orbital dynamics, problems such as low precision and intensive computation have greatly hampered the application of these methods. Aiming at solving these problems, many nonlinear uncertainty propagators have been proposed in the past two decades. To motivate this research area and facilitate the development of orbital uncertainty propagation, this paper summarizes the existing linear and nonlinear uncertainty propagators and their associated applications in the field of orbital mechanics. Frameworks of methods for orbital uncertainty propagation, the advantages and drawbacks of different methods, as well as potential directions for future efforts are also discussed.},
  comment  = {- Explains Uncertainty propagation proces
- The Gaussian error hyper-ellipsoid magnifies and rotates with the increasing of propagation time, and gradually becomes non-Gaussian due to the nonlinear nature of dynamics.
- The navigation uncertainties are added into the estimated state at the initial time, while the dynamic model uncertainties exist across the whole propagation process. Maneuvers may be executed out of the invisible arc, in this case the actuation uncertainties should be added into the propagation at the time of each maneuver.},

  abstract  = {This paper points out the flaws in using the extended Kalman filter (EKE) and introduces an improvement, the unscented Kalman filter (UKF), proposed by Julier and Uhlman (1997). A central and vital operation performed in the Kalman filter is the propagation of a Gaussian random variable (GRV) through the system dynamics. In the EKF the state distribution is approximated by a GRV, which is then propagated analytically through the first-order linearization of the nonlinear system. This can introduce large errors in the true posterior mean and covariance of the transformed GRV, which may lead to sub-optimal performance and sometimes divergence of the filter. The UKF addresses this problem by using a deterministic sampling approach. The state distribution is again approximated by a GRV, but is now represented using a minimal set of carefully chosen sample points. These sample points completely capture the true mean and covariance of the GRV, and when propagated through the true nonlinear system, captures the posterior mean and covariance accurately to the 3rd order (Taylor series expansion) for any nonlinearity. The EKF in contrast, only achieves first-order accuracy. Remarkably, the computational complexity of the UKF is the same order as that of the EKF. Julier and Uhlman demonstrated the substantial performance gains of the UKF in the context of state-estimation for nonlinear control. Machine learning problems were not considered. We extend the use of the UKF to a broader class of nonlinear estimation problems, including nonlinear system identification, training of neural networks, and dual estimation problems. In this paper, the algorithms are further developed and illustrated with a number of additional examples.},

  year     = {2007},
  month    = jan,
  abstract = {A systematic method is developed that uses dynamical systems theory to model, analyze, and construct low-energy ballistic lunar transfers (BLTs). It has been found that low-energy BLTs may be produced by intersecting the stable manifold of an unstable Earth-Moon three-body orbit with the Earth. A spacecraft following such a trajectory is only required to perform a single maneuver, namely, the Trans-Lunar Injection maneuver, in order to complete the transfer. After the Trans-Lunar Injection maneuver, the spacecraft follows an entirely ballistic trajectory that asymptotically approaches and arrives at the target lunar three-body orbit. Because these orbit transfers require no orbit insertion maneuver at the three-body orbit, the transfers may be used to send spacecraft 25--40\% more massive than spacecraft sent to the same orbits via conventional, direct transfers. From the targeted three-body orbits, the spacecraft may transfer to nearly any region within the Earth-Moon system, including any location on the surface of the Moon. The systematic methods developed in this research allow low-energy BLTs to be characterized by six parameters. It has been found that BLTs exist in families, where a family of BLTs consists of transfers whose parameters vary in a continuous fashion from one end of the family to the other. The families are easily identified and studied using a BLT State Space Map (BLT Map). The present research studies BLT Maps and has surveyed a wide variety of BLTs that exist in the observed families. It has been found that many types of BLTs may be constructed between 185-km low Earth parking orbits and lunar three-body orbits that require less than 3.27 km/s and fewer than 120 days of transfer time. Under certain conditions, BLTs may be constructed that require less than 3.2 km/s and fewer than 100 days of transfer time. It has been found that BLTs may implement LEO parking orbits with nearly any combination of altitude and inclination; they may depart from their LEO parking orbits nearly any day of each month; and they may target a variety of different classes of unstable Earth-Moon three-body orbits. Finally, studies are provided that address how low-energy transfers impact the design of spacecraft systems and how BLT Maps may be implemented as pragmatic tools in the design of practical lunar missions.},

  abstract = {The invariant manifolds associated with periodic orbits in the vicinity of the collinear libration points in the planar CR3BP have been previously demonstrated as mechanisms for transport. Trajectories that pass between adjoining regions within the zero-velocity curves pass through the invariant manifold tubes. In particular, the invariant manifolds associated with the unstable L1 and L2 periodic libration point orbits may be exploited to construct transit orbits between the interior and exterior regions associated with the zero-velocity curves. In this investigation, periapse Poincare maps are used to display the manifolds and to distinguish regions of escape and, conversely, regions of long-term capture. Manifold periapse structures are employed as a design tool to construct planar trajectories with predetermined characteristics. The strategies that are developed are demonstrated by producing planar trajectories with predetermined behaviors, namely, long-term capture orbits and transit trajectories, as well as heteroclinic and homoclinic connections. Additionally, path approximations are generated for four Jupiter family comets that experience temporary satellite capture. Periapse Poincare maps are also employed to design three-dimensional transit trajectories in the spatial circular restricted three-body problem.},

A nonlinear consider approach is utilized by incorporating the covariances of the unobservable uncertain atmospheric density and the ballistic coefficient into the state estimate covariance; parameters are specifically not estimated directly to improve the navigation accuracy and robustness during the Mars entry phase. Perturbation is introduced to analyze the navigation state errors from each unobservable uncertain parameter. Numerical simulations show that the presented ECKF-based navigation algorithm is more accurate and robust than the augmented extended Kalman filter for unobservable uncertain parameters. © 2014 COSPAR.

Based on unperturbed Kepler orbit dynamics and J2-perturbed orbit dynamics respectively, sufficient and necessary conditions of k-order local weak observability are mathematically proved for the autonomous navigation system. Observability-based modified EKF, modified UKF, and modified SDREF are presented and used as navigation algorithms.

  abstract = {A relative navigation method for autonomous formation flying using the state-dependent Riccati equation filter (SDREF) is presented. In the SDREF, nonlinear relative dynamics, including J2 perturbation, are parameterized into a state-dependent coefficient (SDC) form without any loss of nonlinearity. The relative navigation algorithm is established based on the carrier-phase differential GPS (CDGPS) and single-frequency GPS data, in which the SDREF is used as a nonlinear estimator. To evaluate the SDREF performance, two different extended Kalman filters (EKFR1 and EKFR2) are introduced. The dynamic models of all the filters are based on relative motion including J2 perturbation. However, the SDREF and the EKFR1 use linear state propagation, whereas EKFR2 employs nonlinear state propagation. The navigation simulation is performed for each filter using live GPS signals simulated by a GPS signal generator, and the result is analyzed in terms of estimation accuracy and computational load. As a result, the SDREF provides a relative navigation solution with 3-D RMS accuracies of 6.0mm and 0.153mm/s for position and velocity, respectively, for a separation of 50km with a computation time of approximately 34s. The simulation results demonstrate that the SDREF estimates the relative states as rapidly as the EKFR1 and as accurately as the EKFR2, which means that the developed SDREF combines the strong points of EKFR1 and EKFR2 and overcomes their disadvantages.},

This paper proposes a novel solution for cooperative autonomous OD for a system comprised of three spacecraft, by employing inertial angles-only measurements. Based on the two-body dynamics of each spacecraft, the observability problem for the two-spacecraft and three-spacecraft systems is analyzed with the Lie-derivative criterion. It is deduced that the two-spacecraft system is third-order locally weakly unobservable, while the three-spacecraft system with three sets of inter-spacecraft observations is third-order locally weakly observable under certain sufficient conditions. To complement the theoretical analysis, we use a numerical method to compute the observability measure to illustrate the degree of observability. Several scenarios are designed to demonstrate the influence of orbital configurations, of J2 dynamics, and measurement noise on the degree of observability. In addition, the observability of the three-spacecraft system is also compared with the two-spacecraft system. Finally, practical cases of three-spacecraft autonomous OD are simulated which demonstrate the application and feasibility of the proposed method.},

A routine monitoring program at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center has recorded over 300 impacts since 2006. A selection of 126 flashes recorded during periods of photometric skies was analyzed, creating the largest and most homogeneous dataset of lunar impact flashes to date. Standard CCD photometric techniques were applied to the video and the luminous energy, kinetic energy, and mass are estimated for each impactor. Shower associations were determined for most of the impactors and a range of luminous efficiencies was considered. The flux to a limiting energy of 2.5×10−6kT TNT or 1.05×107J is 1.03×10−7km−2h−1 and the flux to a limiting mass of 30g is 6.14×10−10m−2yr−1 at the Moon. Comparisons made with measurements and models of the meteoroid population indicate that the flux of objects in this size range is slightly lower (but within the error bars) than flux at this size from the power law distribution determined for the near Earth object and fireball population by Brown et al. (Brown, P.G., Spalding, R., ReVelle, D., Tagliaferri, E., Worden, S. [2002]. Nature 420, 294–296).

  abstract = {Fragments of asteroids and comets constantly encounter the Earth and Moon in their orbits, impacting them as meteoroids. Observations of meteor showers on Earth have been studied for at least 50 years, in order to construct accurate Solar System meteoroid models. More recently, Earth-based telescopic observations of the light flashes produced by lunar meteoroid impacts have revealed useful in the validation and improvement of such meteoroid models. However, Earth-based lunar observations are restricted by weather, geometric and illumination conditions. As such, it has been proposed that a lunar orbiter could improve the detection rate of lunar meteoroid impact flashes. Assessing which orbit a spacecraft should fly in order to detect these flashes and improve current Earth-based observation methods is the aim of this thesis. The study is restricted to spacecraft with the CubeSat format and its inherent limitations, since it is also inserted in the context of the feasibility study of the Lunar Meteoroid Impacts Observer (LUMIO) and ESA’s Lunar CubeSats for Exploration challenge.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;A methodology of sequential orbital trade-offs was followed, taking into account acceptance criteria based on the mission requirements and selection criteria based on the research objective. The goal was maximise the number of meteoroid detections, during the mission lifetime, while minimising the mission ∆V budget. Circular Frozen Orbits, Earth–Moon L2 Lyapunov, Halo, Near-Rectilinear, Vertical, Distant-Retrograde and Low-Prograde orbits were selected as candidates, based on a preliminary orbital trade-off. In order to determine the total number of meteoroid detections possible from a certain orbit, the lunar meteoroid environment was modelled and a coverage analysis tool was developed to determine the payload FOV-area in the lunar nightside.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Frozen Orbits were found to allow the detection of meteoroid impacts with kinetic energies too small with respect to the desired, so the design space was restricted to CRTBP orbits. From Lyapunov, Halo, Near-Rectilinear and Vertical Orbits it would be possible to detect between 1000 and 10000 impacts during the mission lifetime, but detections from some DROs could be one order of magnitude larger. Nonetheless, since transfer costs to DROs are known to be high, a Near-Rectilinear Orbit, with a minimal ∆V budget, was chosen as the operational orbit.},

Advanced CubeSat missions such as the Lunar Meteroid Impact Observer (LUMIO), will use more complex attitude determination and control systems, increasing the need for advanced fault detection. Traditionally this requires model-based fault detection methods which are complicated, computation heavy, and highly sensitive to disturbances. Machine learning has proven proficient at fault detection in several non-space related applications, but training data including spacecraft faults is not available. In this research an especially lightweight unsupervised learning method for fault detection is designed for the LUMIO attitude determination and control \&lt;br/\&gt; components. The result is a system capable of detecting artificially induced bias, calibration error, and drifting measurement faults on the scale of 0.1 mrad/s\&lt;br/\&gt;in the IMU, with no false alarms being raised. The method was tested on simulated LUMIO telemetry from the IMU and reaction wheels as well as on real spacecraft telemetry from the OPS-SAT sun sensor, star tracker, reaction wheels and IMU. In both cases, excellent fault detection and false alarm performance was observed indicating the potential of this method for application in CubeSat AOCS fault detection and isolation.},

We investigate a possible control strategy for the spacecraft on the halo orbits around the L1 and L2 collinear libration points aiming to evaluate the station keeping performance. The station-keeping strategy is based on the elimination of unstable component of motion by periodical velocity corrections performed in unstable directions. The simulations were performed in circular restricted three body problem. The impact of spacecraft position and velocity measurement accuracy, as well as the precision of the control maneuvers, on the station keeping costs, was calculated and studied. It was found that the measurement accuracy of the velocity components of motion and the precision of control burns implementation have the highest impact on the performance of the control strategy.},

  abstract = {Periodic orbits in the Restricted Three-Body Problem are widely adopted as nominal trajectories by different missions. To maintain periodic orbits in a three-body regime, a stationkeeping strategy based on a high-order Target Point Approach (TPA) is proposed, where fuel-optimal and error-robust TPA parameters are acquired from stochastic global optimization. Accurate TPA maneuvers are calculated in a high-order fashion enabled by Differential Algebra techniques. Orbit determination epoch is selected using a sensitivity analysis based on the convergence radius of a stroboscopic map. Stochasticity is handled by incorporating Monte Carlo simulations in the process of optimization and the evaluation of high-order ODE expansions is employed to supplant the time-consuming numerical integration. Two specific types of periodic orbits, Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits and Quasi-Satellite Orbits, are investigated to demonstrate the validity and efficiency of the strategy.},

We first discuss the solutions of the Fokker–Planck equation for a deterministic system with a Gaussian boundary condition. Next, we derive an analytic expression of a nonlinear trajectory solution using a higher-order Taylor series approach, discuss the region of convergence for the solutions, and apply the result to spacecraft applications. Such applications consist of nonlinear propagation of the mean and covariance matrix, design of statistically correct trajectories, and nonlinear statistical targeting. The two-body and Hill three-body problems are chosen as examples and realistic initial uncertainty models are considered. The results show that the nonlinear map of the trajectory uncertainties can be approximated in an analytic form, and there exists an optimal place to perform a correction maneuver, which is not found using the linear method.},

  abstract = {In Space Situational Awareness (SSA), it is crucial to assess the uncertainty related to the state vector of resident space objects (RSO). This uncertainty plays a fundamental role in, for example, collision risk assessment and re-entry predictions. A realistic characterization of this uncertainty is, therefore, necessary.The most common representation of orbital uncertainty is through a Gaussian (or normal) distribution. However, in the absence of new observations, the uncertainty grows over time and the Gaussian representation is no longer valid under nonlinear dynamics like space mechanics. This study evaluates the time when the uncertainty starts becoming non-Gaussian in nature.  Different algorithms for evaluating the normality of a distribution were implemented and Monte Carlo tests were performed on them to assess their performance. Also, the distances between distributions when they are propagated under linear and nonlinear algorithms were computed and compared to the results from the Monte Carlo statistics tests in order to predict the time when the Gaussianity of the distribution breaks. Uncertainty propagation using StateTransition Tensors and Unscented Transform methods were also studied. Among the implemented algorithms for evaluating the normality of a distribution, it was found that Royston’s method gives the best performance. It was also found that if the Normalized L2 distance between the linear and non-linear propagated distributions is greater than 95\%, then uncertainty starts to become non-Gaussian. In the best case scenario of unperturbed two-body motion, it is observed that the Gaussianity is preserved for at least three orbital periods in the case of Low-Earth and Geostationary orbits when initial uncertainty corresponds to the mean precision of the space debris catalog. If the initial variances are reduced, then Gaussianity is preserved for a longer period of time. Time for which Gaussian assumption is valid on orbital uncertainty is also dependent on the initial mean anomaly. Effect of coordinates transformation on Gaussianity validity time is also analyzed by considering uncertainty in Cartesian, Keplerian and Poincaré coordinate systems.  This study can therefore be used to improve space debris cataloguing.},

The first method is the Henze-Zirkler test, which operates on a random particle sample. The variability of its result is quantified. Using this method, departure from normality has been found to occur in three stages which are detailed. The second test compares the offset in whitened space of the predicted state to the predicted covariance mean obtained from the unscented transform. This test is much more efficient than the random particle based approach and can be applied using any perturbations model. The comparison is performed on the state estimation error in Cartesian space and using two-body motion without process noise. The more efficient, unscented transform based approach shows excellent agreement with the Henze-Zirkler test for constructed test cases. Application to orbit determination results from passive optical observations assessed with a Batch-Least-Squares orbit determination however reveals some discrepancies which have yet to be understood and underline the importance of rigorous testing.},

  abstract = {Modeling and simulation for complex applications in science and engineering develop behavior predictions based on mechanical loads. Imprecise knowledge of the model parameters or external force laws alters the system response from the assumed nominal model data. As a result, one seeks algorithms for generating insights into the range of variability that can be the expected due to model uncertainty. Two issues complicate approaches for handling model uncertainty. First, most systems are fundamentally nonlinear, which means that closed-form solutions are not available for predicting the response or designing control and/or estimation strategies. Second, series approximations are usually required, which demands that partial derivative models are available. Both of these issues have been significant barriers to previous researchers, who have been forced to invoke computationally intense Monte-Carlo methods to gain insight into a systems nonlinear behavior through a massive sampling process. These barriers are overcome by introducing three strategies: (1) Computational differentiation that automatically builds exact partial derivative models; (2) Automatic development of state transition tensor series-based solution for mapping initial uncertainty models into instantaneous uncertainty models; and (3) Development of nonlinear transformations for mapping an initial probability distribution function into a current probability distribution function for computing fully nonlinear statistical system properties. The resulting nonlinear probability distribution function (pdf) represents a Liouiville approximation for the stochastic Fokker Planck equation. Several applications, using nonlinear systems, are presented that demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mathematical developments, where the solution is validated by using a Mont-Carlo simulation method. A nonlinear covariance algorithm is presented that uses a closed-form solution for evaluating the expectation values of high-order tensor models for Gaussian variables. The general modeling methodology is expected to be broadly useful for science and engineering applications in general, as well as grand challenge problems that exist at the frontiers of computational science and mathematics.},

The expected positioning precision during the final descent and at the landing site is demonstrated here with a variance-covariance analysis starting from reasonable assumptions about the capabilities of a potential dedicated LCNS system. The performance in positioning and navigation achievable during a generic moon-landing phase significantly outperforms existing ground-based baseline solutions, enabling the stringent requirements from the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) to be met.},

The optimal interlink network topologies and Distributed Satellite Systems (DSS) geometry have been investigated based on the Circular-Restricted Three-Body problem (CRTBP) and the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for state estimation. The network topologies consisted of all the possible combinations of 16 spacecraft at various L1/L2 Halo, Lyapunov, and Lunar orbits. It has been shown that the autonomous navigation system provided better state estimation results for the mesh topology than for the centralized topology. Overall, the lunar satellite network topologies consisting of orbits with large inter-satellite link distances and short orbital periods would bene\_t most from the radiometric autonomous navigation.},

Many real-world applications rely on a first-order approximation of nonlinear equations of motion for propagation of orbit uncertainty. The nonlinear effects that are ignored during the linearization process can greatly influence the accuracy of the solution. A comparative analysis of linear and nonlinear orbit uncertainty propagation is presented in order to attempt to determine when linearized uncertainty becomes non-Gaussian. An examination of performance metrics is then accomplished to compare linearly propagated uncertainty to uncertainty propagated using a second-order approximation. An attempt is then made to develop a performance metric that determines when propagated uncertainty is no longer Gaussian. The results show it is difficult to determine a clear method of defining when the linear approximated uncertainty is no longer Gaussian, but there are metrics that can be implemented given a user-defined threshold of performance.},

Two distinctly different approaches using Monte Carlo methods are discussed: (1) the end point is a fixed but unknown value (e.g., the maximally exposed individual, the average individual, or a specific individual) or (2) the end point is an unknown distribution of values (e.g., the variability of exposures among unspecified individuals in the population). In the first case, values are sampled at random from distributions representing various “degrees of belief” about the unknown “fixed” values of the parameters to produce a distribution of model results. The distribution of model results represents a subjective confidence statement about the true but unknown assessment end point. The important input parameters are those that contribute most to the spread in the distribution of the model results. In the second case, Monte Carlo calculations are performed in two dimensions producing numerous alternative representations of the true but unknown distribution. These alternative distributions permit subject confidence statements to be made from two perspectives: (1) for the individual exposure occurring at a specified fractile of the distribution or (2) for the fractile of the distribution associated with a specified level of individual exposure. The relative importance of input parameters will depend on the fractile or exposure level of interest. The quantification of uncertainty for the simulation of a true but unknown distribution of values represents the state-of-the-art in assessment modeling.},

  abstract = {The last decade saw a renewed interest on the Moon as a well suited training premise in preparation to manned mission to Mars, but also as an interesting target itself, for scientific investigations, technological developments and new markets opportunities. As a result, numerous and very different missions to the Moon are currently being studied and implemented, assuming to have our satellite quite crowded soon. Such a scenario motivates the settling of space infrastructures to offer recurrent services like data relays, communication links and navigation in the cislunar environment which would facilitate and enlighten the single mission’s implementation and operation. The paper presents the strategy adopted to address the design of the orbital configuration for a distributed architecture to answer the communication and navigation needs to serve at the best the diversified lunar missions scenario expected for the next decades. First, a set of parameters of merit are identified and explained in their mathematical expression and physical meaning. Then, different regions of interest for possible future missions are identified and mapped to the relevant performances wanted for that specific region. Last a Multi-Objective Optimisation framework is presented, both in the exploited genotype and the different objectives participating to the definition of the cost function, in order to provide a versatile tool. The paper critically discusses the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting the best suited distributed orbital architectures for the servicers according to the expected service performance in specific user regions, spread all over the Earth–Moon volume — from Earth vicinity to Lunar surface, considering also robustness aspects. The benefits in the exploitation of the multibody dynamical regime offered by the Earth–Moon system to set up the most promising orbital set with a minimum number of servicing spacecraft are underlined as well.},

  abstract = {This paper offers an early examination of the challenges of navigating a crewed vehicle, with all of the associated unmodeled accelerations that arise from the crew's activities, in an orbit about the Earth-Moon L2 point. The combination of the unstable nature of libration orbits with the lack of acceleration knowledge makes the station keeping strategy challenging. It is found that a combination of ground tracking and satellite-to-satellite tracking produces the most favorable navigation accuracy. This paper examines the costs and benefits of applying LiAISON (Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation) to a crewed mission in an unstable L2 orbit.},

  abstract   = {Orbit determination of spacecraft in orbit has been mostly dependent on either GNSS satellite signals or ground station telemetry. Both methods present their limitations, however: GNSS signals can only be used effectively in earth orbit, and ground-based orbit determination presents an inherent latency that increases with the Earth–spacecraft distance. For spacecraft flying formations, an alternative method of orbit determination, independent of external signals, consists in the observation of the spacecraft’s position with respect to the central body through the relative positioning history of the spacecraft within the formation. In this paper, the potential of the relative positioning method is demonstrated in the context of the SunRISE mission, and compared with the mission’s previously proposed orbit determination methods. An optimization study is then made to find the optimal placement of a new spacecraft in the formation so as to maximize the positioning accuracy of the system. Finally, the possibility of removing part of the system’s relative bearing measurements while maintaining its observability is also studied. The resulting system is found to be observable, but ill-conditioned.},

For the satellites that are far from each other, it may be difficult to obtain relative bearing measurement due to poor visibility. To address this difficulty, this paper proposes a novel scheme, where three satellites, whose relative ranges are rather small such that the relative bearings can be observed, are used as beacons for the navigation of the other satellites that are invisible. The feasibility of the proposed navigation scheme is analyzed by using the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB), with the consideration of the availability of relative bearing measurements. In addition, the multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) algorithm is adopted to improve the convergence speed of the estimator in the presence of large initial errors. Simulation results illustrate the high performance of the proposed scheme. © 2012 IAA.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous cislunar spacecraft navigation is critical to mission success as communication to ground stations and access to global positioning system (GPS) signals could be lost. However, if the satellite has a camera of sufficient quality, geometric line-of-sight (unit vector) measurements can be made to known lunar landmarks (e.g., Tycho Crater) to provide observations that enable autonomous estimation of the position and velocity of the spacecraft. In this study, an improved batch gaussian initial orbit determination (IOD) differential corrector (DC) algorithm, based on the approximated values of the two-body f and g series, is applied to initialize a (non-conic based) circular restricted three body problem (CR3BP) extended Kalman Filter (EKF) navigator. This navigator collects geometric line-of-sight unit vector (angle only) measurements to a known location on the Moon to sequentially estimate the position and velocity of an observer spacecraft flying on an approximate southern L1 Halo orbit. In this study, it was found that the best approach is to initialize the CR3BP EKF (navigator) using the solution from the batch DC filter with at least 10 measurements taken against the perceived centroid of Tycho Crater. Thereafter, it is best to continue the navigator with subsequent measurements taken against the same center coordinates of the Tycho Crater, where these coordinates are now expressed in the CR3BP rotating frame. For successful conic-based batch filter initialization and long-term CR3BP EKF convergence, it was found that the cadence for all optical measurements should be taken at 10 minutes for a simulated measurement noise of 0.1° one sigma uncertainty about the line-of-sight measurement unit vector.},

The derivation includes all necessary equations up to the fourth-order expansions in the dynamics and the controls. These are first derived for the general case for a finite burn beginning at the epoch time; simplifications are made for when the target is the spacecraft state at a desired final time, and the controls at the epoch time are impulsive  Δv Δ 𝑣 ’s. An application is presented comparing the STT method with a linearized numerical predictor–corrector for computing an impulsive station-keeping maneuver in an unstable halo orbit around the Earth–moon  L 1 𝐿 1  Lagrange point. The STT method is shown to perform significantly faster, while also converging on accurate solutions for long-horizon targets where the predictor–corrector method fails. The formulation is able to accommodate any number of perturbations in the dynamics, rendering it suitable for onboard operational usage. This approach provides promise for fast and efficient determination of the desired controls to achieve a nonlinear target constraint surface in a highly nonlinear dynamic environment.},

In this paper we present a method for approximating STTs by aligning the STTs with particularly unstable directions. This strategy allows us to isolate the most important terms in the higher-order STTs and ignore any less important terms. This method, which we call directional state transition tensors (DSTTs), is applied to several examples in two- and three-body dynamic systems, and it is shown to perform well for both nonlinear state and state uncertainty propagation. The method produces similar results to the full STTs, but requires significantly fewer elements to be stored, which can result in up to 1000× improvements in speed for nonlinear uncertainty propagation computations. DSTTs are promising for expanding the use of STTs to situations with highly nonlinear dynamics but limited computational resources, such as on-board a spacecraft.},

The second-order solutions derived for state and measurement prediction, on which to base the optimal association, are set up. The optimal association is solved by the contract network algorithm to reduce the computing cost. Finally, a second-order extended Kalman filter is designed to estimate the orbit of each spacecraft. The proposed method is successfully applied for solving a four-spacecraft tracking problem. Simulations show that all the four targets are well tracked. The method demonstrates close to 100\% data association precision. The proposed method is proved to be efficient and effective to solve the multi-spacecraft tracking problem.},

  abstract = {The usage of state transition tensors (STTs) was proved as an effective method for orbital uncertainty propagation. However, orbital maneuvers and their uncertainties are not considered in current STT-based methods. Uncertainty propagation of spacecraft trajectory with maneuvers plays an important role in spaceflight missions, e.g., the rendezvous phasing mission. Under the effects of impulsive maneuvers, the nominal trajectory of a spacecraft will be divided into several segments. If the uncertainty is piecewise propagated using the STTs one after another, large approximation errors will be introduced. To overcome this challenge, a set of modified STTs is derived, which connects the segmented trajectories together and allows for directly propagating uncertainty from the initial time to the final time. These modified STTs are then applied to analytically propagate the statistical moments of navigation and impulsive maneuver uncertainties. The probability density function is obtained by combining STTs with the Gaussian mixture model. The proposed uncertainty propagator is shown to be efficient and affords good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. It also has no dimensionality problem for high-dimensional uncertainty propagation.},

In order to simulate a station-keeping procedure in a dynamic model as realistic as possible, LPOs generated in the circular restricted three-body problem (CRTBP) are discretized and reconverged in a geocentric inertial system for later simulations. After that, based on the dynamic property of the state transition matrix, a modified strategy of selecting target points for station-keeping is presented to reduce maneuver costs. By considering both the solar gravity and radiation pressure in a nominal LPO design, station-keeping simulations about fuel consumption for real LPOs around both collinear and triangular libration points are performed in a high-fidelity ephemeris model. Results show the effectivity of the modified strategy with total maneuver costs reduced by greater than 10\% for maintaining triangular LPOs.},

  abstract  = {Based on the candidate architectures of the libration point satellite navigation system proposed in our previous work, a navigation performance study is conducted in this paper to verify the cislunar navigation ability of the proposed system. Using scalar satellite-to-satellite range measurement between the user and libration point navigation satellites, a virtual lunar exploration mission scenario is developed to verify the navigation performance of the candidate Earth-Moon L1,2,4,5 four-satellite constellations. The simulation results indicate that the libration point satellite navigation system is available for cislunar navigation and the navigation accuracy of a few tens of metres can be achieved for both the trans-lunar cruise and lunar orbit phase. Besides that, it is also found that the navigation accuracy of the libration point satellite navigation system is sensitive to the orbit of the L1 satellite. Once the L1 navigation satellite is located in the Halo orbit or vertical Lyapunov orbit, the proposed system can present a better navigation performance in cislunar space.},

For a small-amplitude orbit, the orbital path as viewed from the Earth traces out a Lissajous figure. This is due to a small difference in the fundamental frequencies of the in-plane and out-of-plane oscillations. However, when the amplitude of the in-plane oscillation is greater than 32 379 km, there is a corresponding value of the out-of-plane amplitude that will produce a path where the fundamental frequencies are equal.

A systematic analysis based on the time domain and phase space is performed including the distribution, duration, and frequency of shadows. First, the Lindstedt-Poincare and second-order differential correction methods are used in conjunction with the DE421 planetary ephemeris to achieve a mission trajectory family in a high-precision ephemeris model. Next, on the basis of a conical shadow model, the influence of different orbital phases and amplitudes on the shadow is analyzed. The distribution of the shadow is investigated as well. Finally, the configuration of the shadow and its characteristics are studied. This study provides an important reference and basis for mission orbit design and shadow avoidance for relay satellites at an Earth-Moon Lagrange point.},

  abstract = {The reliability of the uncertainty characterization, also known as uncertainty realism, is of the uttermost importance for Space Situational Awareness (SSA) services. Among the different sources of uncertainty related to the orbits of Resident Space Objects (RSOs), the uncertainty of dynamic models is one of the most relevant ones, although it is not always included in orbit determination processes. A classical approach to account for these sources of uncertainty is the consider parameters theory, which consists in including parameters in the underlying dynamical models whose variance aims to represent the uncertainty of the system. However, realistic variances of these consider parameters are not known a-priori. This work presents a method to infer the variance of the consider parameters, based on the distribution of the Mahalanobis distance of the orbital differences between predicted and estimated orbits, which theoretically shall follow a \$\${\textbackslash}chi {\textasciicircum}2\$\$distribution under Gaussian assumption. This paper presents results in a simulated scenario focusing on Geostationary (GEO) regimes. The effectiveness and traceability of the uncertainty sources is assessed via covariance realism metrics.},

  abstract = {Recent literature in applied estimation theory reflects growing interest in the sigma-point (also called unscented ) formulation for optimal sequential state estimation, often describing performance comparisons with extended Kalman filters as applied to specific dynamical problems [c.f. 1, 2, 3]. Favorable attributes of sigma-point filters are described as including a lower expected error for nonlinear even non-differentiable dynamical systems, and a straightforward formulation not requiring derivation or implementation of any partial derivative Jacobian matrices. These attributes are particularly attractive, e.g. in terms of enabling simplified code architecture and streamlined testing, in the formulation of estimators for nonlinear spaceflight mechanics systems, such as filter software onboard deep-space robotic spacecraft. As presented in [4], the Sigma-Point Consider Filter (SPCF) algorithm extends the sigma-point filter algorithm to the problem of consider covariance analysis. Considering parameters in a dynamical system, while estimating its state, provides an upper bound on the estimated state covariance, which is viewed as a conservative approach to designing estimators for problems of general guidance, navigation and control. This is because, whether a parameter in the system model is observable or not, error in the knowledge of the value of a non-estimated parameter will increase the actual uncertainty of the estimated state of the system beyond the level formally indicated by the covariance of an estimator that neglects errors or uncertainty in that parameter. The equations for SPCF covariance evolution are obtained in a fashion similar to the derivation approach taken with standard (i.e. linearized or extended) consider parameterized Kalman filters (c.f. [5]). While in [4] the SPCF and linear-theory consider filter (LTCF) were applied to an illustrative linear dynamics/linear measurement problem, in the present work examines the SPCF as applied to nonlinear sequential consider covariance analysis, i.e. in the presence of nonlinear dynamics and nonlinear measurements. A simple SPCF for orbit determination, exemplifying an algorithm hosted in the guidance, navigation and control (GN\&C) computer processor of a hypothetical robotic spacecraft, was implemented, and compared with an identically-parameterized (standard) extended, consider-parameterized Kalman filter. The onboard filtering scenario examined is a hypothetical spacecraft orbit about a small natural body with imperfectly-known mass. The formulations, relative complexities, and performances of the filters are compared and discussed.},

Previous studies concluded that the cooperative OD system in the two-body dynamics is observable using the inertial angle measurement. This paper performs an observability analysis for the inertial angle-only cooperative OD system based on the observability matrix (OM), and finds that the previous conclusions do not hold for some special configurations. Eight special configurations are proposed, and for each configuration, the unobservable orbit elements are analytically revealed by analyzing the linear relationship among different columns of the OM. Moreover, a method of improving the observability of the two-spacecraft system is proposed by adding another spacecraft. An extended Kalman filter is employed to numerically illustrate the observability of the proposed special configurations and to show the relationship between the observability and the convergence ratio of estimations. Monte Carlo simulations show that the convergence ratios of the observable orbit elements and state combinations are higher than 97\%, while convergence ratios of the unobservable states are lower than 70\%. With one non-planar elliptic orbit added, all the elements of the three-spacecraft system are observable, and the estimated errors converge within 6 h. The results found in this paper can provide a reference for the design and management of the constellation.},

  abstract = {The inter-satellite relative navigation method—based on radio frequency (RF) range and angle measurements—offers good autonomy and high precision, and has been successfully applied to two-satellite formation missions. However, two main challenges occur when this method is applied to multi-microsatellite formations: (i) the implementation difficulty of the inter-satellite RF angle measurement increases significantly as the number of satellites increases; and (ii) there is no high-precision, scalable RF measurement scheme or corresponding multi-satellite relative navigation algorithm that supports multi-satellite formations. Thus, a novel multi-satellite relative navigation scheme based on inter-satellite RF range and angle measurements is proposed. The measurement layer requires only a small number of chief satellites, and a novel distributed multi-satellite range measurement scheme is adopted to meet the scalability requirement. An inter-satellite relative navigation algorithm for multi-satellite formations is also proposed. This algorithm achieves high-precision relative navigation by fusing the algorithm and measurement layers. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme requires only three chief satellites to perform inter-satellite angle measurements. Moreover, with the typical inter-satellite measurement accuracy and an inter-satellite distance of around 1 km, the proposed scheme achieves a multi-satellite relative navigation accuracy of {\textasciitilde}30 cm, which is about the same as the relative navigation accuracy of two-satellite formations. Furthermore, decreasing the number of chief satellites only slightly degrades accuracy, thereby significantly reducing the implementation difficulty of multi-satellite RF angle measurements.},

  abstract   = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in lunar missions, particularly with the growing role of small satellites facilitated by piggyback launch opportunities. Typically, ground-based radiometric tracking is the workhorse to establish the necessary navigation solution in these missions, however, this could be expensive, while small satellites development is expected to be at low cost. To address this challenge, autonomous navigation presents a potential solution: this study explores the satellite-to-satellite tracking-based autonomous on-board orbit determination method for a satellite formation in cislunar space. Several factors affect the performance of orbit determination, and one critical aspect is the timing of tracking windows. Basically, it is crucial to determine when to collect the most useful observations to optimize the outcome of the navigation filter. In some cases, there might be operational constraints such as inter-satellite distance due to the limited onboard power for ranging. This study investigates particle swarm optimization-based satellite-to-satellite tracking window planning. The findings of this work demonstrate that particle swarm optimization offers a near-optimal solution for tracking windows, taking into account constraints arising from the spacecraft itself or from other design choices. In summary, particle swarm optimization provides near-optimal tracking windows by minimizing the overall orbit determination error. The results presented have the potential to enhance the design of satellite formations performing autonomous on-board orbit determination and contribute to cost- effective mission planning solutions.},

  abstract = {Angles-only navigation methods are compelling for distributed space systems (DSS) such as swarms and constellations. However, complex dependencies between state observability and system parameters present a challenging design problem. This paper proposes a unified angles-only observability analysis and design framework enabling designers of a DSS to 1) analytically determine whether its orbit state is observable, 2) numerically estimate its expected navigation performance, and 3) intelligently optimize the system to meet navigation requirements. First, a new system measurement topology representation is proposed for which analytic orbit observability can be assessed via a set of graphical conditions. Second, methods for numeric estimation of the achievable state covariance are augmented with auxiliary state variables, dynamics uncertainty, and measurement availability constraints. Third, a system cost function is developed and the topological and numeric methods are placed within a quasi-Newton optimization framework to enable automatic system design. The optimization is applied to a distributed science swarm and a space situational awareness constellation in lunar orbit. Both scenarios converge to a global cost minimum and output designs that achieve user requirements under realistic measurement conditions and constraints. Combined analytic and numeric methods therefore presents a powerful tool for design of angles-only DSS.},

We offer a scheme by which formal covariances may be adapted to be an accurate measure of orbital uncertainties and show how that adaptation performs against both simulated and real space-object data. We also apply these covariance adaptation methods to the process of observation association using many simulated and real data test cases. We demonstrate that covariance-informed observation association can be reliable, even in the case when only two tracks are available.

  abstract = {Precision orbit determination for geodetic applications requires force models even for small perturbations. Radiation from the Sun and Moon is a significant source of perturbation in lunar orbits and inadequate modeling of radiation pressure (RP) can lead to large position errors. This paper describes the short-term effect of RP on the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), which has a position knowledge requirement of 50 m to 100 m in total and below 1 m radially. We compared models of varying complexity to determine the benefits and computational cost of high-accuracy RP modeling. We found that (1) the accelerations differ greatly depending on the Sun position, (2) only a paneled spacecraft model can account properly for changing orientation and geometry of LRO, and (3) a constant-albedo model is sufficient for lunar radiation, which is dominated by the thermal component. A spherical harmonics model for lunar albedo increases computational cost with little gain in the attained accuracy. If RP is neglected, the along-track position errors can be as large as 1100 m and the radial error varies periodically with an amplitude of up to 24 m, highlighting the importance of adequate force modeling to meet LRO's orbit determination requirements.},

  abstract = {The Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE) mission is an upcoming lunar flight demonstration, with a targeted launch in early 2022. The primary objective of the mission is to test out navigation and operations in the same Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) that will be utilized by NASA’s Lunar Gateway.  In addition to this objective, CAPSTONE contains a dedicated flight board for the Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System (CAPS), a framework for autonomous or near-autonomous navigation in cislunar space developed by Advanced Space. During the mission, CAPS will demonstrate onboard orbit determination via both one-way uplink measurements and crosslink radiometric measurements with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO). This paper previews the expected performance of these two experimental data types with a set of high-fidelity simulations using realistic CAPSTONE concept of operations (CONOPS) and radio specifications. For CAPSTONE, the nominal tracking architecture will rely on the standard two-way radiometric measurements of the Deep Space Network (DSN) – CAPS is intended is a technology demonstration. However, solutions will be processed onboard, and the expected navigation performance of these experimental data types are compared against the expected ground-based navigation performance.  The goal of CAPS is ultimately to provide a framework for autonomous navigation in cislunar space. The CAPS experiments onboard CAPSTONE will be the first on-orbit step towards this goal. While the early experiments will not replace the utilization of ground-based navigation, they should be able to supplement it and work towards a future where the reliance on two-way ground networks is greatly reduced. For the CAPSTONE orbit and radio specifications, the one-way uplink measurements are expected to provide navigation solutions with uncertainties on the order of single kilometers in position and single cm/s in velocity. These solutions could, in theory, be utilized to design stationkeeping maneuvers onboard the spacecraft and maintain its NRHO over time. Simulations of the expected crosslink measurements also show navigation performances similar to the expected performance of two-way tracking. In addition to examining the CAPSTONE operational CONOPS, the performance of a conceptual ground-based one-way beaconing system is examined, compared to standard two-way radiometric tracking, and used in conjunction with the expected crosslink performance to study what may be possible in terms of cislunar autonomous navigation provided by CAPS in the future.},

This paper demonstrates that relative optical measurements provide full inertial estimates of an agent and target spacecraft, while simultaneously enabling classification of unknown maneuvers in the cislunar environment. To achieve this objective two subtasks are demonstrated. First, the spacecraft-to-spacecraft absolute tracking method, which estimates the absolute state of two vehicles using relative measurements, is tested for observability and shown to produce consistent filter solutions given optical sensors. Second, maneuver classification is performed by labeling an estimated control profile generated from the optimal control based estimator. Collectively, this sequential methodology enables an agent craft to autonomously navigate itself while observing a target craft and classifying its maneuvers.},

Each type of analysis offers unique insights into the problem that may be mutually beneficial. In this case, the investigation is conducted in the quicker-Earth-Moon system; the reference orbit is a halo orbit computed in a full solar system model. Halo and Lissajous orbits are solutions that represent bounded motion in the vicinity of a collinear libration point. The problem of controlling a spacecraft moving near an inherently unstable libration point orbit is of current interest. In the late 1960},

  abstract = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-0999.vid The characteristics of Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits (NRHOs) that make them desirable for cislunar operations also introduce navigation challenges. The orbit’s large apolune distance provides excellent coverage of the lunar south pole, and its Earth-facing plane ensures constant line-of-sight with ground stations. However, the nearly perpendicular motion to the Earth-spacecraft line results in poor observability of range biases, and the necessarily low perilune altitude results in highly dynamic and sensitive perilune passages. Preliminary work indicates that range biases and state estimates near apolune and perilune are unintuitively related to range and range-rate measurement quality. This study seeks to clarify the relationship between measurements and navigation solutions, as well as to provide insight into filter designs that are more suitable for NRHO navigation operations.},

  abstract  = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2021-4132.vidLunar comms and nav infrastructure – first data relay orbiter Lunar Pathfinder, operational in 2024, paves the way for full constellation by 2030s A key to sustainable lunar exploration is access to permanent, low-cost and high performance service infrastructure. Easy access to support services such as communication and navigation will rapidly become essential for lunar missions, for technical and economic reasons. A similar trend has already been observed in the transportation domain in the USA, where 14 CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) compete regularly to provide transportation to the Moon as a service. To an emerging space nation with a low-budget science mission on the far-side, this infrastructure will be an enabler by removing the need for a relay spacecraft. To a commercial endeavour looking to invest in ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization), it will help close the business case for investment and grow the demand. Early 2021, in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA), Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) started the clock on the development of Lunar Pathfinder, the first data-relay lunar orbiter to commercially offer communication services to missions on the surface and in orbit around the Moon. From 2024 onwards, lunar missions of all types (orbiters, rovers, landers, stationary instruments) will be able to access the service and dramatically enhance the value of their mission by lifting the multiple constraints of transferring data back to Earth. Transmitting Direct to Earth (DTE) presents several limitations that can be lifted by the use of a comms relay infrastructure. DTE relies on direct line of sight, which makes it impossible for far-side missions, and a risk for mobile missions likely to encounter obstructing terrain. It also limits the achievable data-rate and contact time with the often oversubscribed deep space ground stations, therefore constraining the overall volume of data that can be retrieved by the end user. With a store and forward capability, a proximity link, two simultaneous channels in S-band and UHF, Lunar Pathfinder data-relay spacecraft is designed to lift these constraints, allowing longer upload durations at higher data-rates with each of the lunar assets, and bulk-sending data, at high speed, back to an Earth Ground Station, ready for distribution to the end users. In addition to its main mission, Lunar Pathfinder will also carry a hosted payload, an ESA GNSS receiver, with the objective of running a GNSS weak signal detection experiment from lunar orbit, a significant step towards navigation service provision for lunar assets. The decision to proceed with building the Lunar Pathfinder infrastructure and services, in the frame of a commercial partnership between SSTL and ESA, was the result of a successful study phase realized for ESA in collaboration with Goonhilly Earth Station (GES). It was also enabled by NASA’s interest in using the communication services for their own robotic assets. Several customer missions are now actively working with SSTL Lunar (a new brand of SSTL, dedicated to the provision of lunar services) to prepare their communication service package. And we are not stopping there… As lunar missions evolve and move from mainly science and exploration towards in-situ resource utilization and purely commercial endeavours, such as tourism, they will increasingly rely on a lunar infrastructure that can provide permanent, low-cost and high performance key support services. Building upon the Lunar Pathfinder experience and the commercialisation of its services, an SSTL-led consortium, including established telecom operators, as well as space and ground segment integrators, is already working on the next generation infrastructure. With a space segment based on a constellation of data-relay orbiters and strong interoperability requirements with other infrastructure elements such as Gateway, the overall system will integrate into the backbone infrastructure.},

With limited terrestrial-based infrastructure to support this number of missions, as well as restricted visibility over intended mission areas, there is a need for space navigation system autonomy. Autonomous on-board navigation systems in the lunar environment have been the subject of study by a number of authors. Suggested systems include optical navigation, high-sensitivity Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, and navigation-linked formation flying. This paper studies the interoperable nature and fusion of proposed autonomous navigation systems that are independent of Earth infrastructure, given challenges in distance and visibility. This capability is critically important for safe and resilient mission architectures. The proposed elliptical frozen orbits of lunar navigation satellite systems will be of special interest, investigating the derivation of orbit determination by non-terrestrial sources utilizing celestial observations and inter-satellite links. Potential orbit determination performances around 100 m are demonstrated, highlighting the potential of the approach for future lunar navigation infrastructure.},

In the past decades, lunar missions have almost entirely relied on Direct-to-Earth (DTE) communications, whilst using ranging radiometric measurements from Earth for navigation. The growing trend in the number of missions to the Moon is creating demand for the deployment of a dedicated lunar communication and navigation infrastructure to support the international community. The European Space Agency’s vision, represented by the Moonlight initiative, is to stimulate the creation and development of lunar communication and navigation services that will support the next generation of institutional and private Lunar Exploration Missions, including enhancing the performance of those missions currently under definition. Within this initiative, ESA has defined a lunar navigation roadmap in 3 phases: firstly, making use of terrestrial GNSS signals (Phase 1), then adding in some limited (initial) lunar infrastructure (Phase 2) before transitioning to full lunar service capabilities (Phase 3). This contribution presents both ongoing and planned activities related with phase 1 and 2 of the roadmap. Regarding phase 1, the GNSS experiment planned with Lunar Pathfinder is described and the expected performance levels are presented: the experiment aims to demonstrate, for the first time in a lunar orbit, the use of a GNSS receiver to compute the satellite orbit on-board in real time. Regarding phase 2 of the roadmap, aiming to provide a dedicated navigation service in cis-lunar space as part of the Moonlight initiative, this contribution describes the Moonlight navigation service and analyses the potential user performance levels that can be achieved when landing on the lunar surface.},

Among many others, Swarm Intelligence (SI), a substantial branch of Artificial Intelligence, is built on the intelligent collective behavior of social swarms in nature. One of the most popular SI paradigms, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO), is presented in this work. Many changes have been made to PSO since its inception in the mid 1990s. Since their learning about the technique, researchers and practitioners have developed new applications, derived new versions, and published theoretical studies on the potential influence of various parameters and aspects of the algorithm. Various perspectives are surveyed in this paper on existing and ongoing research, including algorithm methods, diverse application domains, open issues, and future perspectives, based on the Systematic Review (SR) process. More specifically, this paper analyzes the existing research on methods and applications published between 2017 and 2019 in a technical taxonomy of the picked content, including hybridization, improvement, and variants of PSO, as well as real-world applications of the algorithm categorized into: health-care, environmental, industrial, commercial, smart city, and general aspects applications. Some technical characteristics, including accuracy, evaluation environments, and proposed case study are involved to investigate the effectiveness of different PSO methods and applications. Each addressed study has some valuable advantages and unavoidable drawbacks which are discussed and has accordingly yielded some hints presented for addressing the weaknesses of those studies and highlighting the open issues and future research perspectives on the algorithm.},

The primary goal of ArgoMoon is to capture images of the Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage. Then, ArgoMoon will be placed into a highly elliptical orbit around the Earth with several encounters with the Moon. In this phase, the navigation process will require a precise Orbit Determination (OD) and a Flight Path Control (FPC) to satisfy the navigation requirements. The OD will estimate the spacecraft trajectory using ground-based radiometric observables. The FPC is based on an optimal control strategy designed to reduce the dispersion with respect to the reference trajectory and minimize the total ΔV. A linear approach was used to determine the optimal targets and the number and location of the orbital maneuvers. A covariance analysis was performed to assess the expected OD performance and its robustness. The analysis results show that the reference translunar trajectory can be successfully flown and the navigation performance is strongly dependent on the uncertainties of the ArgoMoon’s Propulsion Subsystem and of the orbit injection.},

In this work, a revised preliminary mission analysis approach, merging the nominal trajectory optimization with a complete navigation assessment, is formulated in a general form and three main blocks composing it are identified. Then, the integrated approach is specialized for a cislunar test case scenario, represented by the transfer trajectory from a low lunar orbit to an halo orbit of the CubeSat LUMIO, and each block is modeled with mathematical means. Eventually, optimal solutions, minimizing the total costs, are sought, showing the benefits of an integrated approach.},

The Nelder–Mead (NM) method is a well-known local search heuristic for BBO that has been applied to solve many real-world problems from way back because of its promising performance. However, this method has a strong dependence on initialization due to its local search tendency. Nevertheless, a discussion on the proper initialization of the NM method is limited to the recent study by Wessing (Optim Lett 13(4):847–856, 2019), which is solely based on an analysis using the simple sphere function. In this study, we take a further step to improve Wessing’s result by massively investigating how the initialization affects the search performance in views of the initial simplex size and shape and a constraint handling method that is employed on 24 BBO benchmarking problems. Based on the numerical results, we present the empirical best practice for the initialization of the NM method for cases involving a limited evaluation budget.},

Two initial conditions are considered: a halo orbit in the vicinity of Europa, and a resonant orbit around Jupiter. Primer vector theory is utilized to determine the number of impulses and the gradient information needed for this highly nonlinear, many revolution optimization problem. A custom multi-shooting algorithm is developed to mitigate the extreme sensitivities from long flight times through regions dominated by chaotic dynamics. New equations are derived to inform decisions to keep or remove small intermediate maneuvers. Optimization of previously generated, near-optimal halo-to-capture transfers verifies that an energetic-based minimum ΔV provides a good initial measure of optimality. For the resonant boundary scenario, a new 3D periodic orbit is generated that incorporates natural transfers between a resonant orbit and a halo orbit. The intermediate halo orbit enables phase-free connection of the capture and resonant phases. The end-to-end transfers successfully converge to quasi-ballistic, manifold-like trajectories.},

The proposed algorithm embeds the circular and elliptic restricted three-body problems, the four-body bicircular and concentric models, an averaged n-body model, and, at the top hierarchic ladder, the full ephemeris spice-based restricted n-body problem. The equations of motion are reduced to the assignment of 13 time-varying coefficients, which multiply the states and the gravitational potential to reproduce the proper vector field. This approach is powerful because it allows, for instance, an efficient and quick way to check solutions for different dynamics and parameters. It is shown how a gradual increase of the dynamics complexity greatly improves accuracy, the chances of success and the convergence rate of a continuation algorithm, applied to low-energy transfers.},

  abstract  = {A comprehensive study on the autonomous orbit determination (AOD) performance of satellite pairs in halo orbits and distant retrograde orbits (DROs) is carried out. A factor called dynamic and geometric dilution of precision (DAGDOP) is proposed to simultaneously incorporate influences from the dynamics and geometry of satellite pairs. Based on the DAGDOP, the effect of different observation arcs on the AOD accuracy is investigated. Next, the AOD accuracy of three different types of satellite pairs—halo+halo, DRO+DRO, and halo+DRO—is systematically analyzed. The hybrid halo+DRO type shows the best overall accuracy. Finally, the AOD performance of the hybrid type is verified in a realistic model. Our studies find that the average AOD accuracy of the halo orbit is about 170 meters, and that of the DRO is about 190 meters. The relative time synchronization error of two satellites is less than 30 nanoseconds.},

  abstract   = {NASA is developing a two-phased approach to quickly return humans to the Moon and establish a sustainable presence in orbit and on the surface. The two phases run in parallel, and both have already begun, with selection of the first Gateway element, the Power and Propulsion Element, solicitation activities focused on an American-built, industry-provided Human Landing System, and discussions with industry and international partners about potential opportunities for collaboration. Phase 1 is driven exclusively by the administration's priority to land the first woman and the next man on the lunar South Pole by 2024. In this phase, NASA and its partners will develop and deploy two Gateway components: the Power and Propulsion Element (PPE) that will launch in 2022, and the Habitation and Logistics Outpost (HALO), a minimal habitation capability) that will launch in 2023. Both will launch on commercial rockets, as will Gateway logistics deliveries to outfit the ship and provide supplies for surface expeditions. This initial Gateway configuration represents the beginning of its capability buildup, and the primary components required to support the first human expedition to the lunar South Pole. NASA's baseline reference approach for human expeditions on the surface is for Human Landing Systems to aggregate and dock to the Gateway, then deploy to the lunar South Pole with two astronauts aboard. Phase 2 is focused on advancing the technologies that will foster a sustainable presence on and around the Moon - a lasting and productive presence enabled by reusable systems, access for a diverse body of contributing partners, and repeatable trips to multiple destinations across the lunar surface. In this Phase, we will advance sustainable systems to make surface expeditions more repeatable and affordable. While the Gateway is the first of its kind to be funded, the concept has been proposed for decades as a necessary and foundational capability for a sustainable return to the Moon, and a port for vehicles embarking to farther destinations. It supports every tenet of Space Policy Directive-1 and the infrastructure it provides is critical to an accelerated return to the Moon, and access to more parts of the Moon than ever before. The Gateway also provides a unique platform to conduct cross-discipline science. Science instruments, both internal and external to the Gateway, have the potential to reveal new findings in space science, Earth science, and biological research data from deep space. Additionally, the broad science community will be able to utilize the communications and data relay capabilities of the Gateway, beginning with the PPE in Phase 1. This paper will outline the cross-discipline activities NASA is currently conducting, and those the agency anticipates conducting in the future to successfully implement Phases 1 and 2 in the lunar vicinity, all while preparing for humanity's next giant leap: Mars.},

  abstract = {Plans to establish a satellite network around the Moon to support communication, position, navigation, and timing services are rapidly evolving. Satellites that are part of this system broadcast their ephemeris as finite parameters to lunar users for user state estimation. We investigate lunar satellite ephemeris parameterization to identify the optimal parameterization to broadcast to a lunar user. The proposed framework directly approximates the lunar satellite position and velocity in the inertial frame, along with approximating conversion parameters necessary for representation in the lunar fixed frame. The framework leverages signal-in-space-error requirements as constraints in the approximation process to guide the search for the best parameterization. We evaluate the performance of our proposed framework for satellites in a Low Lunar Orbit and an Elliptical Lunar Frozen Orbit. The performance of different methods is assessed based on the precision of the ephemeris prediction, approximation interval, and message size. We showcase the ability of the developed framework to approximate satellite ephemeris for both orbits to the desired precision by adjusting the approximation period and the number of broadcasted parameters. Particularly, we demonstrate that model formulations with a standard polynomial basis and a Chebyshev polynomial basis produce feasible solutions for ephemeris approximation at varying epochs in orbits, abiding by stringent signal-in-space-error requirements.},
