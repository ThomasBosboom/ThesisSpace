The space segment foresees a 12U CubeSat, placed at Earth–Moon L2, equipped with an optical instrument, the LUMIO-Cam, which is able to spot the flashes produced by impacts of meteoroids with the lunar surface. In this paper, the work undertaken to design the baseline orbit of LUMIO is documented. The methodology is thoroughly described, both in qualitative and quantitative terms, in support to the mission analysis trade-off activities. The baseline solution is presented with evidence to support the orbit design.},

  abstract  = {NASA's Global Exploration Strategy and proposed lunar architecture present a roadmap for future U.S. missions. The exploration plan begins with robotic precursor missions, followed by short human sorties, eventually progressing to a permanent base on the lunar surface. NASA's Lunar Architecture Team concluded that this permanent base would be located near the lunar South Pole. The location of an outpost at the lunar South limits direct communication links with the Earth. A lunar relay element will be necessary to provide critical communication and navigation support for the upcoming missions. This paper presents a highly evolvable, low-cost lunar relay constellation concept using small satellites in Halo orbits about the Earth-Moon libration points L1 and L2. The initial constellation is designed to provide coverage of the lunar south pole in support of the inaugural robotic missions and is easily expanded to provide global coverage. Two satellites in an L2 Halo orbit provide continuous South Pole coverage for the initial constellation. A final constellation providing nearly continuous global coverage can be achieved by the addition of two spacecraft in a Halo orbit about Li. A basic set of requirements and desired capabilities for the constellation is developed, based on NASA reports and Constellation C31 compatibility. A preliminary spacecraft bus and subsystems design is presented along with expected performance.},

  abstract = {This study presents an autonomous orbit determination system based on crosslink radiometric measurements applied to a future lunar CubeSat mission to clearly highlight its advantages with respect to existing ground-based navigation strategies. This work is based on the Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) method which provides an autonomous navigation solution solely using satellite-to-satellite measurements, such as range and/or range-rate, to estimate absolute spacecraft states when at least one of the involved spacecraft has an orbit with a unique size, shape, and orientation. The lunar vicinity is a perfect candidate for this type of application due to the asymmetrical gravity field: the selected lunar mission, an Earth-Moon L2 (EML2) Halo orbiter, has an inter-satellite link between a lunar elliptical frozen orbiter. Simulation results show that, even in case of high-measurement errors (in the order of 100 m, 1σ), the navigation filter estimates the true states of spacecraft at EML2 with an error in the order of 500 m for position, and 2 mm/s for velocity, respectively and the elliptical lunar frozen orbiter states can be estimated in the order of 100 m for position and 1 cm/s for velocity, respectively. This study shows that range-only measurements provide better state estimation than range-rate-only measurements for this specific situation. Different bias handling strategies are also investigated. It has been found that even a less accurate ranging method, such as data-aided ranging, provides a sufficient orbit determination solution. This would simplify the communication system design for the selected CubeSat mission. The most observable states are found to be position states of the lunar orbiter via the observability analysis. In addition, the best tracking windows are also investigated for the selected mission scenario.},
  comment  = {The characteristics of the acceleration function determine whether inter-satellite range or range-rate measurements can be used alone to estimate the absolute and relative Spacecraft (S/C) states.

Considering the asymmetric gravity field in the cislunar vicinity, it is possible to build such an autonomous navigation system.

In order to deal with on-board power limitations, time-derived ranging methods are a possible options for small satellites, dependent on data rate. Another measurement type is range-rate and this can be derived from the Doppler shift between satellites but, again, this measurement type suffers from on-board limitations.

This study didn’t consider clock drift and aging in the measurement model due to the short simulation duration. The simulation time is 14 days. Also doesn't consider other ranging methods other than time-based.

  abstract = {Distant retrograde orbits (DROs) in cislunar space offer a promising option for providing navigation services to satellites in the Earth-Moon system due to their long-term orbital stability and unique three-body orbital dynamics. The Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) technique is used to process the satellite-to-satellite tracking (SST) range measurements between a DRO satellite and another satellite in cislunar space to determine their absolute orbital states. The paper evaluates the navigation performances of the LiAISON, which are subject to dynamic model errors and satellite-borne clock errors. The clock models are presented, with a specific emphasis on modeling the non-Gaussian stochastic noise time series that are consistent with the clock instability. Comprehensive simulation results show that the SST system is observable. The DRO and Earth-orbit or lunar-orbit can obtain position accuracies of 100 m and several meters, respectively, and time synchronization accuracy is better than 100 ns. The Earth-Moon transfer orbit is less observable due to its long-orbital period that results in poor measurement geometry.},
  comment  = {LiAISON technique requires that at least one of the satellites be deployed in the asymmetrical gravity field of a three‐body system, such as a halo orbit around the lunar libration point.
In a symmetrical acceleration field, such as a two‐body system, a time history of the SST range measurements can only determine the size, shape, and relative orientation of both satellites’ orbits.

DROs are more stable and are used for communication relay as well. By contrast, Earth‐Moon liberation point halo orbits are usually unstable, requiring navigation and station‐keeping maneuvers once or twice per orbit. The ARTEMIS mission has successfully demonstrated quasi‐periodic station‐keeping at a cost of 5‐7 m/s per year. NRHOs are a subset of the L2 halo family and have better stability than other halos, with an annual station‐keeping cost of less than 5 m/s.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in space technology provide an opportunity for small satellites to be launched in cislunar space. However, tracking these small satellites still depends on ground-based operations. Autonomous navigation could be a possible solution considering the challenges presented by costly ground operations and limited onboard power available for small satellites. There have been various studies on autonomous navigation methods for cislunar missions. One of them, LiAISON, provides an autonomous orbit determination solution solely using inter-satellite measurements. This study aims at providing a detailed performance analysis of crosslink radiometric measurements based on autonomous orbit determination for cislunar small satellite formations considering the effects of measurement type, measurement accuracy, bias, formation geometry, and network topology. This study shows that range observations provide better state estimation performance than range-rate observations for the autonomous navigation system in cislunar space. Line-of-sight angle measurements derived from radiometric measurements do not improve the overall system performance. In addition, less precise crosslink measurement methods could be an option for formations in highly observable orbital configurations. It was found that measurement biases and measurements with high intervals reduce the overall system performance. In case there are more than two spacecraft in the formation, the navigation system in the mesh topology provides a better overall state estimation than the centralized topology.},
  comment  = {Limitations also come from the satellites, such as onboard power available for communications.

In addition, it is difficult to track all these small satellites due to the limited capacity of ground stations. Limitations also come from the satellites, such as onboard power available for communications. Considering all these challenges, an autonomous navigation system for cislunar missions could provide a possible solution. Also because makes use to existing technologies.

The orbit determination performance of LiAISON depends on various factors, such as measurement type, accuracy, bias, frequency, relative geometry between satellites, and others.

The observability of the system depends on one of the spacecraft occupying a unique orbit. Unique orbit depends on the asymmetry of an orbit. As part of the observability analysis, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), observability Gramian, and estimation error
covariance were considered. The degree of observability can be either checked via the observability Gramian or the information matrix. Both methods are related to each other via the measurement covariance matrix which provides weighted information about its observability. SVD of either gives degree of observability of state. Also condition number or observability index.

  abstract   = {In recent years, there is a growing interest in small satellites for deep space exploration. The current approach for planetary navigation is based on ground-based radiometric tracking. A new era of low-cost small satellites for space exploration will require autonomous deep space navigation. This will decrease the reliance on ground-based tracking and provide a substantial reduction in operational costs because of crowded communication networks. In addition, it will be an enabler for future missions currently impossible. This review investigates available deep space navigation methods from an autonomy perspective, considering trends in proposed deep space small satellite missions. Autonomous crosslink radiometric navigation, which is one of the best methods for small satellites due to its simplicity and the use of existing technologies, is studied, including available measurement methods, enabling technologies, and applicability to the currently proposed missions. The main objective of this study is to fill the gap in the scientific literature on the autonomous deep space navigation methods, deeply for crosslink radiometric navigation and to aim at showing the potential advantages that this technique could offer to the missions being analyzed. In this study, a total of 64 proposed deep space small satellite missions have been analyzed found from a variety of sources including journal papers, conference proceedings, and mission websites. In those missions, the most popular destinations are found to be cislunar space and small bodies with the purpose of surface mapping and characterization. Even though various autonomous navigation methods have been proposed for those missions, most of them have planned to use the traditional ground-based radiometric tracking for navigation purposes. This study also shows that more than half of the missions can benefit from the crosslink radiometric navigation through the inter-satellite link.},

- The covariance is not an a-posteriori measure of the tracking data quality and accuracy. This can only be derived from an analysis of the final distribution of the measurement residuals and by solving for systematic errors.
- Consider covariance matrix gives more realistic measure of OD accuracy. The consider covariance calculus is therefore well suited to assessing the impact of systematic errors in the orbit determination process. Typical examples of consider parameters are measurement biases, station location errors or uncertainties in the drag and radiation pressure model.
- Aside from the approximate state xapr0 that is required to start the least-squares orbit determination, some information on the accuracy of this value is often available (error covariance matrix).},

Earth-based lunar observations are restricted by weather, geometric and illumination conditions, while a lunar orbiter can improve the detection rate of lunar meteoroid impact flashes, as it would allow for longer monitoring periods. This paper will focus on the communications and radio navigation system of the mission, designed for the ESA roadmap for lunar exploration. LUMIO has been designed to operate autonomously after deployment from a lunar mother spacecraft in a low inclination lunar orbit and to reach without human intervention his final destination orbit close to the Earth-Moon L2 point, where science can be carried out. Being the destination orbit always in view from Earth (despite a distance of 460000 - 480000 km), Direct-to-Earth communication was added to the mission as a mean to reduce risk and allow independent verification of several of the innovative technologies that would be demonstrated, first of all autonomous navigation. A detailed link budget analysis will be presented for all mission phases for both the link with the mother spacecraft in low lunar orbit and the link with Earth. Beside defining the achievable data transfer, we will focus also on evaluating the available ground stations to better evaluate mission cost with respect to science return. Radio-navigation performances will also be evaluated to estimate the position and relative velocity accuracy, given also the limited performances available for the on-board navigation transponder. This will help also better defining the on-board autonomous navigation system, constraining the total error budget. Further strategies, such as beacon tones, will be evaluated to lower the overall operational cost by employing continuous monitoring with a low performances ground station and, only when needed, perform high speed downlink using a deep-space class ground station. This strategy is considered of extreme importance, especially for small missions, to allow opportunistic operations on high gain antennas, given their very busy schedule.

Observation of the impacts on the Moon can enable thorough characterization of the Lunar meteoroid flux, which is similar to that of the Earth. While Earth-based Lunar observations are restricted by weather, geometric and illumination conditions, a Lunar-based observation campaign can improve the detection rate and, when observing the Lunar far side, complement in both space and time the observations taken from Earth. The Lunar Meteoroid Impact Observer (LUMIO), one of the two winning concepts of the ESA SysNova Lunar CubeSats for Exploration challenge, is a mission designed to observe, quantify, and characterize the micro-meteoroid impacts on the Lunar far side. It is based on a 12U CubeSat that carries the LUMIO-Cam, a custom-designed optical instrument capable of detecting light flashes in the visible spectrum. The spacecraft is placed on a halo orbit about the Earth–Moon L2 point, where permanent full-disk observation of the Lunar far side can be performed with excellent quality, given the absence of Earth background noise. After passing Phase 0 and an independent feasibility study in the ESA Concurrent Design Facility, the mission has successfully completed its Phase A in March 2021. Although the Phase 0 design of the LUMIO spacecraft was assessed as feasible by the ESA CDF study, a number of critical issues were identified, which have been tackled by the Phase A design. The paper presents the outcome of this Phase A design effort for the LUMIO spacecraft. Particularly relevant changes or updates in the spacecraft design include: a consolidated design of the LUMIO-Cam, with longer baffle for straylight protection; a set of ADCS sensors and actuators with increased redundancy; a combination of Direct-to-Earth communication and inter-satellite link with a mothership in Lunar orbit; use of Earth ranging to complement and validate the current innovative autonomous navigation strategy based on optical observations of the Moon by means of the LUMIO-Cam; re-assessment of the COTS components selection for the power and propulsion systems.},

For small satellites, orbit determination based solely on inter-satellite measurements could be a strong alternative for conventional ground-based navigation support. The possibilities of this autonomous orbit determination method are investigated, using LUMIO and Lunar Pathfinder mission aspects. The feasibility strongly depends on the estimated two-way ranging error, so the dependency between the radio parameters and performance in autonomous orbit determination is explored. To estimate the two-way error a link budget analysis is performed in which the bit rate and antenna gain are free parameters. In an iterative process, the radio parameters are obtained in which autonomous orbit determination can be performed in compliance with LUMIO’s mission requirements.},

Lagrange points are stable positions in the gravitational field of two large bodies that allow for a sustained presence of a spacecraft in a specific region. However, a challenge in operating at these points is the lack of fixed landmarks for orbit determination. The proposed solution involves using inter-satellite links to perform range and range-rate measurements, allowing for accurate computation of the spacecraft’s orbit parameters without the need for any facilities on Earth. Simulations using a fleet of three satellites in Near Rectilinear Halo Orbits around the Earth–Moon Lagrange point, proposed for the Lunar Gateway stations, were conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of the approach. The results show that inter-satellite links can provide reliable and accurate solutions for orbit determination with a DRMS error lower than one meter (90th percentile) and synchronization errors of around one nanosecond. This solution paves the way for a fully autonomous fleet of spacecraft that can be used for observation, telecommunication, and navigation missions.},

  abstract  = {This study investigates the application of the Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAI-SON) technique for multiple small spacecraft in cislunar orbits considering high inter-satellite range measurement errors. The LiAISON method provides an autonomous orbit determination solution using crosslink measurements such as range, and/or range-rate. Inter-satellite ranging can be done via conventional tone or code based methods. Considering the limited on-board transmission power available on small satellites, ranging and data transfer, required to cope with the limited contact time, introduce further observable degradation and limiting performance. For such cases, and to increase the supported data rates, telemetry ranging and time-derived ranging architectures can be used. Unfortunately, in time-derived methods, measurements are not as accurate as using other methods, limiting the ap-plicability of such technique only to few missions. This paper presents a simulation based analysis to understand the limits of LiAISON for a multi-spacecraft mission at the Earth-Moon L1, L2 Halo and Lunar orbits considering high inter-satellite measurements errors due to time-derived and telemetry-based ranging methods and without Doppler measurements. This is specifically targeted at small satellites with limited power budgets and radio links lacking coherent Doppler tracking. The simulation results show that the LiAISON-based autonomous orbit determination works well for configurations of cislunar orbits, having the link between Lagrangian and Lunar orbits, even with high crosslink ranging errors.},

  abstract   = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2022-4382.vidAs cislunar space is poised for significant increases in mission activity, missions large and small are inherently constrained by the current availability of ground tracking systems. Increasing the complexity of this problem is the ambiguity with which schedule and mission scope can be accurately projected. Many of these missions will be operating in orbital regimes that require frequent tracking and station keeping, which drives the demand for navigation even higher. Advanced Space is aiming to mitigate the existing Earth based tracking and communications resource limitations by enabling spacecraft in the cislunar environment to navigate autonomously and reduce the need for oversubscribed ground assets for navigation and maneuver planning. Launched on June 28th, 2022 the Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System Technology Operations and Navigation Experiment (CAPSTONE) mission is utilizing a highly capable 12U CubeSat to demonstrate the Cislunar Autonomous Positioning System (CAPS) software, as well as validate performance of navigation and stationkeeping for future operations in the Near Rectilinear Halo Orbit (NRHO) that NASA has baselined for the Artemis Lunar Gateway architecture. The CAPS software enables cislunar missions to manage their navigation functions on-board and reduces the reliance on Earth based systems. Thus, this mission will provide tangible flight experience to NASA, commercial, and international missions for operations in a demanding orbital regime alongside a technical demonstration of a navigation capability that will support the establishment of necessary infrastructure for activities at the Moon. The mission will have an approximate four month flight with several maneuvers leading up to the NRHO insertion and then perform its primary mission over the next six months. From the launch deployment state, the spacecraft will traverse a low-energy Ballistic Lunar Transfer (BLT), which is an energy-efficient means of transferring from the LEO environment to an orbit near or about the Moon. The spacecraft will perform up to six Trajectory Correction Maneuvers (TCMs) to clean up launch injection, navigation, and maneuver execution errors prior to arriving at its lunar destination. The spacecraft will then perform a relatively small maneuver to insert into the NRHO. Two small clean-up maneuvers are planned to ensure that the spacecraft is successfully inserted into the NRHO. From there, small stationkeeping maneuvers, known as Orbit Maintenance Maneuvers (OMMs), are performed on a weekly cadence to remain in the NRHO. Upon arrival in the NRHO and settling into its daily operations cadence, the CAPSTONE spacecraft will initiate its navigation demonstration mission in collaboration with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) team at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center to demonstrate the CAPS autonomous navigation system. Success criteria for CAPSTONE in this demonstration are defined as 1) semi-autonomous operations and orbital maintenance of a spacecraft in an NRHO, 2) collection of inter-spacecraft ranging data in support of the autonomous navigation process, and 3) execution of the CAPS navigation software in an autonomous mode on-board the CAPSTONE spacecraft. Additionally, CAPSTONE will demonstrate an innovative one-way ranging navigation approach utilizing a Chip Scale Atomic Clock (CSAC) and additional autonomous navigation algorithms. Advanced Space, along with our partners at NASA, the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), Terran Orbital, Stellar Exploration, and Rocket Lab, have developed and implemented the CAPSTONE mission to support both NASA’s upcoming Gateway operations development and the expanding commercial cislunar economy. This high value mission will demonstrate an efficient low energy orbital transfer and NRHO insertion as well as full-scale operations in this unique orbit. Over the next 21 months, CAPSTONE will validate these key operations and navigation technologies required for the success of NASA’s l},
  comment    = {The tracking passes will occur when CAPSTONE is nearer to periapse, as LRO is in a polar, low lunar orbit. The availability of these passes will depend on several factors, including each spacecraft'spower, their relative distances, lunar occultations, pointing constraints, and LRO ongoing science operational priorities.

The objective for CAPSTONE is to accelerate the infusion of autonomous spacecraft navigation, where such crosslink tracking may support the navigation needs of both spacecraft in the link.},

  abstract  = {ABSTRACT: Small satellites are growing in use for educational, scientific, and commercial purposes, usually in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) flights, given their lower costs and associated risks, as well as smaller lead times for assembling and testing. However, the typically short periods of LEO passes bring the need to find ways of optimizing the communication between the ground and space segments. In that direction, several projects have relied on ground station networks to increase the total time of contact with the satellites. In this type of arrangement, the stations agree in monitoring one or more satellites in such a way that, as the spacecraft exits one station’s field of view, another station assumes its tracking, extending the total communication time and compensating the short passes. This type of solution, while very efficient in terms of costs, on the other hand demands a good synchronization procedure, so that all constraints present in its operations are taken into account and the network can operate effectively. This paper aims at describing a model implemented for orchestrating ground station networks that optimizes the communication capacity of the ground network, while taking into account physical constraints not usually considered in other models currently proposed.},

  abstract = {We study the application of Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation (LiAISON) to track vehicles on the far side of the lunar surface. The LiAISON architecture is demonstrated to achieve accurate orbit determination solutions for various mission scenarios in the Earth–Moon system. Given the proper description of the force field, LiAISON is capable of producing absolute orbit determination solutions using relative satellite-to-satellite tracking observations alone. The lack of direct communication between Earth-based tracking stations and the far side of the Moon provides an ideal opportunity for implementing LiAISON. This paper presents a novel approach to use the LiAISON architecture to perform autonomous navigation of assets on the lunar far side surface. Relative measurements between a spacecraft placed in an EML-2 halo orbit and lunar surface asset(s) are simulated and processed. Comprehensive simulation results show that absolute states of the surface assets are observable with an achieved accuracy of the position estimate on the order of tens of meters.},

Although no attempt is made to optimize the control parameters, the most efficient alternative in terms of propellant consumption is identified.

  abstract = {The invariant manifolds associated with periodic orbits in the vicinity of the collinear libration points in the planar CR3BP have been previously demonstrated as mechanisms for transport. Trajectories that pass between adjoining regions within the zero-velocity curves pass through the invariant manifold tubes. In particular, the invariant manifolds associated with the unstable L1 and L2 periodic libration point orbits may be exploited to construct transit orbits between the interior and exterior regions associated with the zero-velocity curves. In this investigation, periapse Poincare maps are used to display the manifolds and to distinguish regions of escape and, conversely, regions of long-term capture. Manifold periapse structures are employed as a design tool to construct planar trajectories with predetermined characteristics. The strategies that are developed are demonstrated by producing planar trajectories with predetermined behaviors, namely, long-term capture orbits and transit trajectories, as well as heteroclinic and homoclinic connections. Additionally, path approximations are generated for four Jupiter family comets that experience temporary satellite capture. Periapse Poincare maps are also employed to design three-dimensional transit trajectories in the spatial circular restricted three-body problem.},

Based on unperturbed Kepler orbit dynamics and J2-perturbed orbit dynamics respectively, sufficient and necessary conditions of k-order local weak observability are mathematically proved for the autonomous navigation system. Observability-based modified EKF, modified UKF, and modified SDREF are presented and used as navigation algorithms.

  abstract = {A relative navigation method for autonomous formation flying using the state-dependent Riccati equation filter (SDREF) is presented. In the SDREF, nonlinear relative dynamics, including J2 perturbation, are parameterized into a state-dependent coefficient (SDC) form without any loss of nonlinearity. The relative navigation algorithm is established based on the carrier-phase differential GPS (CDGPS) and single-frequency GPS data, in which the SDREF is used as a nonlinear estimator. To evaluate the SDREF performance, two different extended Kalman filters (EKFR1 and EKFR2) are introduced. The dynamic models of all the filters are based on relative motion including J2 perturbation. However, the SDREF and the EKFR1 use linear state propagation, whereas EKFR2 employs nonlinear state propagation. The navigation simulation is performed for each filter using live GPS signals simulated by a GPS signal generator, and the result is analyzed in terms of estimation accuracy and computational load. As a result, the SDREF provides a relative navigation solution with 3-D RMS accuracies of 6.0mm and 0.153mm/s for position and velocity, respectively, for a separation of 50km with a computation time of approximately 34s. The simulation results demonstrate that the SDREF estimates the relative states as rapidly as the EKFR1 and as accurately as the EKFR2, which means that the developed SDREF combines the strong points of EKFR1 and EKFR2 and overcomes their disadvantages.},

  abstract = {Fragments of asteroids and comets constantly encounter the Earth and Moon in their orbits, impacting them as meteoroids. Observations of meteor showers on Earth have been studied for at least 50 years, in order to construct accurate Solar System meteoroid models. More recently, Earth-based telescopic observations of the light flashes produced by lunar meteoroid impacts have revealed useful in the validation and improvement of such meteoroid models. However, Earth-based lunar observations are restricted by weather, geometric and illumination conditions. As such, it has been proposed that a lunar orbiter could improve the detection rate of lunar meteoroid impact flashes. Assessing which orbit a spacecraft should fly in order to detect these flashes and improve current Earth-based observation methods is the aim of this thesis. The study is restricted to spacecraft with the CubeSat format and its inherent limitations, since it is also inserted in the context of the feasibility study of the Lunar Meteoroid Impacts Observer (LUMIO) and ESA’s Lunar CubeSats for Exploration challenge.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;A methodology of sequential orbital trade-offs was followed, taking into account acceptance criteria based on the mission requirements and selection criteria based on the research objective. The goal was maximise the number of meteoroid detections, during the mission lifetime, while minimising the mission ∆V budget. Circular Frozen Orbits, Earth–Moon L2 Lyapunov, Halo, Near-Rectilinear, Vertical, Distant-Retrograde and Low-Prograde orbits were selected as candidates, based on a preliminary orbital trade-off. In order to determine the total number of meteoroid detections possible from a certain orbit, the lunar meteoroid environment was modelled and a coverage analysis tool was developed to determine the payload FOV-area in the lunar nightside.\&lt;br/\&gt;\&lt;br/\&gt;Frozen Orbits were found to allow the detection of meteoroid impacts with kinetic energies too small with respect to the desired, so the design space was restricted to CRTBP orbits. From Lyapunov, Halo, Near-Rectilinear and Vertical Orbits it would be possible to detect between 1000 and 10000 impacts during the mission lifetime, but detections from some DROs could be one order of magnitude larger. Nonetheless, since transfer costs to DROs are known to be high, a Near-Rectilinear Orbit, with a minimal ∆V budget, was chosen as the operational orbit.},

Advanced CubeSat missions such as the Lunar Meteroid Impact Observer (LUMIO), will use more complex attitude determination and control systems, increasing the need for advanced fault detection. Traditionally this requires model-based fault detection methods which are complicated, computation heavy, and highly sensitive to disturbances. Machine learning has proven proficient at fault detection in several non-space related applications, but training data including spacecraft faults is not available. In this research an especially lightweight unsupervised learning method for fault detection is designed for the LUMIO attitude determination and control \&lt;br/\&gt; components. The result is a system capable of detecting artificially induced bias, calibration error, and drifting measurement faults on the scale of 0.1 mrad/s\&lt;br/\&gt;in the IMU, with no false alarms being raised. The method was tested on simulated LUMIO telemetry from the IMU and reaction wheels as well as on real spacecraft telemetry from the OPS-SAT sun sensor, star tracker, reaction wheels and IMU. In both cases, excellent fault detection and false alarm performance was observed indicating the potential of this method for application in CubeSat AOCS fault detection and isolation.},

Accurate TPA maneuvers are calculated in a high-order fashion enabled by Differential Algebra techniques.

Stochasticity is handled by incorporating Monte Carlo simulations in the process of optimization and the evaluation of high-order ODE expansions is employed to supplant the time-consuming numerical integration.

  abstract = {The last decade saw a renewed interest on the Moon as a well suited training premise in preparation to manned mission to Mars, but also as an interesting target itself, for scientific investigations, technological developments and new markets opportunities. As a result, numerous and very different missions to the Moon are currently being studied and implemented, assuming to have our satellite quite crowded soon. Such a scenario motivates the settling of space infrastructures to offer recurrent services like data relays, communication links and navigation in the cislunar environment which would facilitate and enlighten the single mission’s implementation and operation. The paper presents the strategy adopted to address the design of the orbital configuration for a distributed architecture to answer the communication and navigation needs to serve at the best the diversified lunar missions scenario expected for the next decades. First, a set of parameters of merit are identified and explained in their mathematical expression and physical meaning. Then, different regions of interest for possible future missions are identified and mapped to the relevant performances wanted for that specific region. Last a Multi-Objective Optimisation framework is presented, both in the exploited genotype and the different objectives participating to the definition of the cost function, in order to provide a versatile tool. The paper critically discusses the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting the best suited distributed orbital architectures for the servicers according to the expected service performance in specific user regions, spread all over the Earth–Moon volume — from Earth vicinity to Lunar surface, considering also robustness aspects. The benefits in the exploitation of the multibody dynamical regime offered by the Earth–Moon system to set up the most promising orbital set with a minimum number of servicing spacecraft are underlined as well.},

The combination of the unstable nature of libration orbits with the lack of acceleration knowledge makes the station keeping strategy challenging. It is found that a combination of ground tracking and satellite-to-satellite tracking produces the most favorable navigation accuracy. This paper examines the costs and benefits of applying LiAISON (Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation) to a crewed mission in an unstable L2 orbit.},

  abstract   = {Orbit determination of spacecraft in orbit has been mostly dependent on either GNSS satellite signals or ground station telemetry. Both methods present their limitations, however: GNSS signals can only be used effectively in earth orbit, and ground-based orbit determination presents an inherent latency that increases with the Earth–spacecraft distance. For spacecraft flying formations, an alternative method of orbit determination, independent of external signals, consists in the observation of the spacecraft’s position with respect to the central body through the relative positioning history of the spacecraft within the formation. In this paper, the potential of the relative positioning method is demonstrated in the context of the SunRISE mission, and compared with the mission’s previously proposed orbit determination methods. An optimization study is then made to find the optimal placement of a new spacecraft in the formation so as to maximize the positioning accuracy of the system. Finally, the possibility of removing part of the system’s relative bearing measurements while maintaining its observability is also studied. The resulting system is found to be observable, but ill-conditioned.},

For the satellites that are far from each other, it may be difficult to obtain relative bearing measurement due to poor visibility. To address this difficulty, this paper proposes a novel scheme, where three satellites, whose relative ranges are rather small such that the relative bearings can be observed, are used as beacons for the navigation of the other satellites that are invisible. The feasibility of the proposed navigation scheme is analyzed by using the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB), with the consideration of the availability of relative bearing measurements. In addition, the multiple model adaptive estimation (MMAE) algorithm is adopted to improve the convergence speed of the estimator in the presence of large initial errors. Simulation results illustrate the high performance of the proposed scheme. © 2012 IAA.},

  abstract  = {Autonomous cislunar spacecraft navigation is critical to mission success as communication to ground stations and access to global positioning system (GPS) signals could be lost. However, if the satellite has a camera of sufficient quality, geometric line-of-sight (unit vector) measurements can be made to known lunar landmarks (e.g., Tycho Crater) to provide observations that enable autonomous estimation of the position and velocity of the spacecraft. In this study, an improved batch gaussian initial orbit determination (IOD) differential corrector (DC) algorithm, based on the approximated values of the two-body f and g series, is applied to initialize a (non-conic based) circular restricted three body problem (CR3BP) extended Kalman Filter (EKF) navigator. This navigator collects geometric line-of-sight unit vector (angle only) measurements to a known location on the Moon to sequentially estimate the position and velocity of an observer spacecraft flying on an approximate southern L1 Halo orbit. In this study, it was found that the best approach is to initialize the CR3BP EKF (navigator) using the solution from the batch DC filter with at least 10 measurements taken against the perceived centroid of Tycho Crater. Thereafter, it is best to continue the navigator with subsequent measurements taken against the same center coordinates of the Tycho Crater, where these coordinates are now expressed in the CR3BP rotating frame. For successful conic-based batch filter initialization and long-term CR3BP EKF convergence, it was found that the cadence for all optical measurements should be taken at 10 minutes for a simulated measurement noise of 0.1° one sigma uncertainty about the line-of-sight measurement unit vector.},

The simulation results indicate that the libration point satellite navigation system is available for cislunar navigation and the navigation accuracy of a few tens of metres can be achieved for both the trans-lunar cruise and lunar orbit phase. Besides that, it is also found that the navigation accuracy of the libration point satellite navigation system is sensitive to the orbit of the L1 satellite. Once the L1 navigation satellite is located in the Halo orbit or vertical Lyapunov orbit, the proposed system can present a better navigation performance in cislunar space.},

First, the Lindstedt-Poincare and second-order differential correction methods are used in conjunction with the DE421 planetary ephemeris to achieve a mission trajectory family in a high-precision ephemeris model. Next, on the basis of a conical shadow model, the influence of different orbital phases and amplitudes on the shadow is analyzed. The distribution of the shadow is investigated as well.

  abstract = {The inter-satellite relative navigation method—based on radio frequency (RF) range and angle measurements—offers good autonomy and high precision, and has been successfully applied to two-satellite formation missions. However, two main challenges occur when this method is applied to multi-microsatellite formations: (i) the implementation difficulty of the inter-satellite RF angle measurement increases significantly as the number of satellites increases; and (ii) there is no high-precision, scalable RF measurement scheme or corresponding multi-satellite relative navigation algorithm that supports multi-satellite formations. Thus, a novel multi-satellite relative navigation scheme based on inter-satellite RF range and angle measurements is proposed. The measurement layer requires only a small number of chief satellites, and a novel distributed multi-satellite range measurement scheme is adopted to meet the scalability requirement. An inter-satellite relative navigation algorithm for multi-satellite formations is also proposed. This algorithm achieves high-precision relative navigation by fusing the algorithm and measurement layers. Simulation results show that the proposed scheme requires only three chief satellites to perform inter-satellite angle measurements. Moreover, with the typical inter-satellite measurement accuracy and an inter-satellite distance of around 1 km, the proposed scheme achieves a multi-satellite relative navigation accuracy of {\textasciitilde}30 cm, which is about the same as the relative navigation accuracy of two-satellite formations. Furthermore, decreasing the number of chief satellites only slightly degrades accuracy, thereby significantly reducing the implementation difficulty of multi-satellite RF angle measurements.},

  abstract   = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in lunar missions, particularly with the growing role of small satellites facilitated by piggyback launch opportunities. Typically, ground-based radiometric tracking is the workhorse to establish the necessary navigation solution in these missions, however, this could be expensive, while small satellites development is expected to be at low cost. To address this challenge, autonomous navigation presents a potential solution: this study explores the satellite-to-satellite tracking-based autonomous on-board orbit determination method for a satellite formation in cislunar space. Several factors affect the performance of orbit determination, and one critical aspect is the timing of tracking windows. Basically, it is crucial to determine when to collect the most useful observations to optimize the outcome of the navigation filter. In some cases, there might be operational constraints such as inter-satellite distance due to the limited onboard power for ranging. This study investigates particle swarm optimization-based satellite-to-satellite tracking window planning. The findings of this work demonstrate that particle swarm optimization offers a near-optimal solution for tracking windows, taking into account constraints arising from the spacecraft itself or from other design choices. In summary, particle swarm optimization provides near-optimal tracking windows by minimizing the overall orbit determination error. The results presented have the potential to enhance the design of satellite formations performing autonomous on-board orbit determination and contribute to cost- effective mission planning solutions.},

By devising metrics for measuring the representations of orbit error, we assess under what circumstances such lore is justified as well as the root cause of the discrepancy between the mathematics of orbital uncertainty and its practical implementation. We offer a scheme by which formal covariances may be adapted to be an accurate measure of orbital uncertainties and show how that adaptation performs against both simulated and real space-object data. We also apply these covariance adaptation methods to the process of observation association using many simulated and real data test cases. We demonstrate that covariance-informed observation association can be reliable, even in the case when only two tracks are available. Satellite breakup and collision event catalog maintenance could benefit from the automation made possible with these association methods.},

In this paper we analyze the impact of the transponder delay, i.e. the processing time between reception and re-emission of a two-way tracking link at the satellite, on tracking observables and on spacecraft orbits. We show that this term, only partially accounted for in the standard formulation of computed space observables, can actually be relevant for future missions with high nominal tracking accuracies or for the re-processing of old missions. We present several applications of our formulation to Earth flybys, the NASA GRAIL and the ESA BepiColombo missions.},

Recent research has determined that satellite-to-satellite range measurements between these two orbits are su cient to perform absolute state estimation as well as relative state estimation of both satellites - a technology known as LiAISON (Linked Autonomous Interplanetary Satellite Orbit Navigation). This study quanties the improvement in accuracy when LiAISON is used to supplement ground tracking of one or both satellites in a very realistic simulation.

  abstract  = {View Video Presentation: https://doi.org/10.2514/6.2021-4132.vidLunar comms and nav infrastructure – first data relay orbiter Lunar Pathfinder, operational in 2024, paves the way for full constellation by 2030s A key to sustainable lunar exploration is access to permanent, low-cost and high performance service infrastructure. Easy access to support services such as communication and navigation will rapidly become essential for lunar missions, for technical and economic reasons. A similar trend has already been observed in the transportation domain in the USA, where 14 CLPS (Commercial Lunar Payload Services) compete regularly to provide transportation to the Moon as a service. To an emerging space nation with a low-budget science mission on the far-side, this infrastructure will be an enabler by removing the need for a relay spacecraft. To a commercial endeavour looking to invest in ISRU (In-Situ Resource Utilization), it will help close the business case for investment and grow the demand. Early 2021, in partnership with the European Space Agency (ESA), Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd (SSTL) started the clock on the development of Lunar Pathfinder, the first data-relay lunar orbiter to commercially offer communication services to missions on the surface and in orbit around the Moon. From 2024 onwards, lunar missions of all types (orbiters, rovers, landers, stationary instruments) will be able to access the service and dramatically enhance the value of their mission by lifting the multiple constraints of transferring data back to Earth. Transmitting Direct to Earth (DTE) presents several limitations that can be lifted by the use of a comms relay infrastructure. DTE relies on direct line of sight, which makes it impossible for far-side missions, and a risk for mobile missions likely to encounter obstructing terrain. It also limits the achievable data-rate and contact time with the often oversubscribed deep space ground stations, therefore constraining the overall volume of data that can be retrieved by the end user. With a store and forward capability, a proximity link, two simultaneous channels in S-band and UHF, Lunar Pathfinder data-relay spacecraft is designed to lift these constraints, allowing longer upload durations at higher data-rates with each of the lunar assets, and bulk-sending data, at high speed, back to an Earth Ground Station, ready for distribution to the end users. In addition to its main mission, Lunar Pathfinder will also carry a hosted payload, an ESA GNSS receiver, with the objective of running a GNSS weak signal detection experiment from lunar orbit, a significant step towards navigation service provision for lunar assets. The decision to proceed with building the Lunar Pathfinder infrastructure and services, in the frame of a commercial partnership between SSTL and ESA, was the result of a successful study phase realized for ESA in collaboration with Goonhilly Earth Station (GES). It was also enabled by NASA’s interest in using the communication services for their own robotic assets. Several customer missions are now actively working with SSTL Lunar (a new brand of SSTL, dedicated to the provision of lunar services) to prepare their communication service package. And we are not stopping there… As lunar missions evolve and move from mainly science and exploration towards in-situ resource utilization and purely commercial endeavours, such as tourism, they will increasingly rely on a lunar infrastructure that can provide permanent, low-cost and high performance key support services. Building upon the Lunar Pathfinder experience and the commercialisation of its services, an SSTL-led consortium, including established telecom operators, as well as space and ground segment integrators, is already working on the next generation infrastructure. With a space segment based on a constellation of data-relay orbiters and strong interoperability requirements with other infrastructure elements such as Gateway, the overall system will integrate into the backbone infrastructure.},

With limited terrestrial-based infrastructure to support this number of missions, as well as restricted visibility over intended mission areas, there is a need for space navigation system autonomy. Autonomous on-board navigation systems in the lunar environment have been the subject of study by a number of authors. Suggested systems include optical navigation, high-sensitivity Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers, and navigation-linked formation flying. This paper studies the interoperable nature and fusion of proposed autonomous navigation systems that are independent of Earth infrastructure, given challenges in distance and visibility. This capability is critically important for safe and resilient mission architectures. The proposed elliptical frozen orbits of lunar navigation satellite systems will be of special interest, investigating the derivation of orbit determination by non-terrestrial sources utilizing celestial observations and inter-satellite links. Potential orbit determination performances around 100 m are demonstrated, highlighting the potential of the approach for future lunar navigation infrastructure.},

  abstract   = {The interest in Moon exploration has substantially grown in the last years, making the Moon an attractive testbed to develop the required technologies and capabilities for human Deep Space exploration. In the past decades, lunar missions have almost entirely relied on Direct-to-Earth (DTE) communications, whilst using ranging radiometric measurements from Earth for navigation. The growing trend in the number of missions to the Moon is creating demand for the deployment of a dedicated lunar communication and navigation infrastructure to support the international community. The European Space Agency’s vision, represented by the Moonlight initiative, is to stimulate the creation and development of lunar communication and navigation services that will support the next generation of institutional and private Lunar Exploration Missions, including enhancing the performance of those missions currently under definition. Within this initiative, ESA has defined a lunar navigation roadmap in 3 phases: firstly, making use of terrestrial GNSS signals (Phase 1), then adding in some limited (initial) lunar infrastructure (Phase 2) before transitioning to full lunar service capabilities (Phase 3). This contribution presents both ongoing and planned activities related with phase 1 and 2 of the roadmap. Regarding phase 1, the GNSS experiment planned with Lunar Pathfinder is described and the expected performance levels are presented: the experiment aims to demonstrate, for the first time in a lunar orbit, the use of a GNSS receiver to compute the satellite orbit on-board in real time. Regarding phase 2 of the roadmap, aiming to provide a dedicated navigation service in cis-lunar space as part of the Moonlight initiative, this contribution describes the Moonlight navigation service and analyses the potential user performance levels that can be achieved when landing on the lunar surface.},

Then, ArgoMoon will be placed into a highly elliptical orbit around the Earth with several encounters with the Moon. In this phase, the navigation process will require a precise Orbit Determination (OD) and a Flight Path Control (FPC) to satisfy the navigation requirements. The OD will estimate the spacecraft trajectory using ground-based radiometric observables. The FPC is based on an optimal control strategy designed to reduce the dispersion with respect to the reference trajectory and minimize the total ΔV. A linear approach was used to determine the optimal targets and the number and location of the orbital maneuvers. A covariance analysis was performed to assess the expected OD performance and its robustness. The analysis results show that the reference translunar trajectory can be successfully flown and the navigation performance is strongly dependent on the uncertainties of the ArgoMoon’s Propulsion Subsystem and of the orbit injection.},

However, miniaturized spacecraft pose different challenges both from the technological and mission analysis point of view. While the former is in constant evolution due to the manufacturers, the latter is an open point, since it is still based on a traditional approach, not able to cope with the new platforms’ peculiarities. In this work, a revised preliminary mission analysis approach, merging the nominal trajectory optimization with a complete navigation assessment, is formulated in a general form and three main blocks composing it are identified. Then, the integrated approach is specialized for a cislunar test case scenario, represented by the transfer trajectory from a low lunar orbit to an halo orbit of the CubeSat LUMIO, and each block is modeled with mathematical means. Eventually, optimal solutions, minimizing the total costs, are sought, showing the benefits of an integrated approach.},
